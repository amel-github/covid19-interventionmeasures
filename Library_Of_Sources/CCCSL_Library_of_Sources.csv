Le 24 janvier 2020, les trois premiers cas sont recensés sur le territoire métropolitain. Le 14 mars, l'épidémie passe au stade 3 et tous les lieux recevant du public non indispensables à la vie du pays sont fermés. À partir du 17 mars à 12 h, afin de réduire à leur plus strict minimum les contacts et les déplacements, la population est confinée à domicile sauf pour des motifs autorisés, afin de stopper la diffusion exponentielle du coronavirus et, ce faisant, réduire le plus possible le nombre de personnes atteintes et donc de morts,. Au 20 avril, le bilan cumulatif des seuls centres hospitaliers participant au système d’information pour le suivi des victimes (Si-vic) et signalements liés à la Covid-19 dans les établissements médico-sociaux depuis le début de la pandémie, publié quotidiennement par l'Agence nationale de santé publique, fait état de 114 657 cas confirmés et 20 265 morts en France. L'Institut Pasteur a le 21 avril évalué qu'environ 5,7% des Français (3,7 millions de personnes) auront été infectés au 11 mai (début prévu du déconfinement), précisant que pour que l'immunité collective soit suffisante pour éviter une deuxième vague, il faudrait 70% de personnes immunisées.

Recent publications have drawn attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine (CQ). Our study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages in patients with established severe COVID-19. Methods We performed a parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial, aiming to assess safety and efficacy of two different CQ dosages as adjunctive therapy of hospitalized patients with SARS in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Eligible participants were allocated to receive orally or via nasogastric tube high dose CQ (600mg CQ twice daily for 10 days or total dose 12g); or low dose CQ (450mg for 5 days, twice daily only on the first day, or total dose 2.7g). In addition, all patients received ceftriaxone and azithromycin. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04323527. Findings Out of a pre-defined 440 patients sample size, 81 patients were enrolled. The high dose CQ arm presented more QTc&gt;500ms (25%), and a trend toward higher lethality (17%) than the lower dosage. Fatality rate was 13.5% (95%CI=6.9-23.0%), overlapping with the CI of historical data from similar patients not using CQ (95%CI=14.5-19.2%). In 14 patients with paired samples, respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only one patient. Interpretation Preliminary findings suggest that the higher CQ dosage (10-day regimen) should not be recommended for COVID-19 treatment because of its potential safety hazards.

"QXKWC9YY","journalArticle","2020","Nakazawa, Eisuke; Ino, Hiroyasu; Akabayashi, Akira","Chronology of COVID-19 Cases on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship and Ethical Considerations: A Report From Japan","Disaster medicine and public health preparedness","","1938-744X","10.1017/dmp.2020.50","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32207674","The Diamond Princess cruise ship has been anchored at the Yokohama port in Japan since February 3, 2020. A total of 691 cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection had been confirmed as of February 23. The government initially assumed that the infection was not spreading aboard and therefore indicated that any persons who either tested negative for the virus or were asymptomatic should immediately disembark. However, on February 5, the government set a 14-day health observation period because of the severity of the infection. Passengers confirmed to be free from infection began disembarking on Day 15 (February 19) of the quarantine. The effectiveness and validity of infection control, justification for the timing of inspections, and even the nature of COVID-19 itself now are all in question. The ethical considerations related to cruise ship infection control include the reasonable justification for isolation, the psychological fragility and quality of life of the isolated passengers and crew members, the procedural justice inherent in a forced quarantine, and the optimization of control measures.The international coordination framework and the global ramifications of such outbreaks should be reevaluated by the international community. Denying a ship's entry based on local politics is incompatible with global justice.

März 2020, weitere umfangreiche Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung des Corona-Virus sowie zur Stärkung der medizinischen und pflegerischen Infrastruktur in Nordrhein-Westfalen beschlossen. Ziel der Maßnahmen ist es, die Anzahl sozialer Kontakte in der Bevölkerung weiter zu reduzieren und so die Ausbreitung des Corona-Virus zu verlangsamen. Zu diesem Zweck wurde unter anderem beschlossen, weitere Einrichtungen und Angebote zu schließen oder zu untersagen, die Öffnungszeiten und Auflagen von Restaurants enger zu fassen und Übernachtungsangebote nur zu ausschließlich nicht touristischen Zwecken weiterhin zuzulassen. Zugleich wird für wichtige Angebote des täglichen Bedarfs die Öffnung an Sonn- und Feiertagen gestattet. Hierzu zählen beispielsweise Geschäfte des Einzelhandels für Lebensmittel und Apotheken. &nbsp; Bei den nordrhein-westfälischen Krankenhäusern sowie bei weiteren Einrichtungen der medizinischen und pflegerischen Versorgung bestehen erhebliche Bedarfe aufgrund der Erfordernisse zur Bewältigung der Corona-Pandemie. Als Soforthilfe werden Krankenhäusern und weiteren Einrichtungen der medizinischen und pflegerischen Versorgung zusätzliche Mittel in Höhe von 150 Millionen Euro zur Verfügung gestellt. &nbsp; Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet: „Die Entwicklung der Infektionen mit dem Corona-Virus in Nordrhein-Westfalen ist nicht nur dynamisch, sondern dramatisch. Es muss nun der Letzte verstehen: Wir befinden uns in einer schweren Krise – für die Gesundheit, für den Wohlstand und für den Zusammenhalt in unserem Land. Die Landesregierung arbeitet Tag und Nacht daran, die Corona-Virus-Pandemie einzudämmen. Wir arbeiten dabei eng mit der Bundesregierung, aber auch im Länderkreis und mit unseren Freunden in Belgien und den Niederlanden zusammen. Nur gemeinsam werden wir es schaffen, das Virus erfolgreich zu bekämpfen und möglichst viele Menschenleben zu retten. Es geht um Leben und Tod. So einfach ist es. Und so schlimm.“ &nbsp; Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann: „Mit dem heutigen Erlass ergänzen wir die kontaktreduzierenden Maßnahmen, die wir bereits am Sonntag ergriffen haben. Dass die Bundesregierung unsere Regelungen explizit als Vorbild für ihre Empfehlungen genannt hat, bestätigt uns in unserer Einschätzung, dass wir mit Besonnenheit und Entschlossenheit gehandelt haben. Das wird auch künftig Maßgabe unseres Handelns sein.“ &nbsp; next prev 1 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Landesregierung beschließt weitere Maßnahmen zur Pandemie-Eindämmung next prev 2 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Landesregierung beschließt weitere Maßnahmen zur Pandemie-Eindämmung next prev 3 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Landesregierung beschließt weitere Maßnahmen zur Pandemie-Eindämmung next prev 4 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Landesregierung beschließt weitere Maßnahmen zur Pandemie-Eindämmung next prev 5 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Landesregierung beschließt weitere Maßnahmen zur Pandemie-Eindämmung Zum Download öffnen Sie die Galerie bitte in der Mediathek. &nbsp; Die weiteren Maßnahmen der Landesregierung zur Eindämmung des Corona-Virus und zur Bewältigung der Auswirkungen beinhalten unter anderem folgende Eckpunkte: &nbsp; Weitere kontaktreduzierende Maßnahmen: In Ergänzung zu den am 15. März 2020 angeordneten Maßnahmen gelten ab dem 16. März 2020 beziehungsweise 17. März 2020 weitere Maßnamen, um zu einer weiteren Verzögerung der Infektionsdynamik beizutragen. Folgende Einrichtungen, Begegnungsstätten und Angebote sind zu schließen beziehungsweise einzustellen: Alle Kneipen, Cafés, Opern- und Konzerthäuser (ab 16. März), alle Messen, Ausstellungen, Freizeit- und Tierparks und Anbieter von Freizeitaktivitäten (drinnen und draußen), Spezialmärkte und ähnliche Einrichtungen, Reisebusreisen, jeglicher Sportbetrieb auf und in allen öffentlichen und privaten Sportanlagen sowie alle Zusammenkünfte in Vereinen (ab 17. März), Spielhallen, Spielbanken, Wettbüros und ähnliche Einrichtungen (ab 16. März), Prostitutionsstätten, Bordelle und ähnliche Einrichtungen (ab 16. März). Alle Spiel- und Bolzplätze sind zu schließen. Der Zugang zu Bibliotheken (außer Bibliotheken an Hochschulen), Mensen, Restaurants und Speisegaststätten sowie Hotels für die Bewirtung von Übernachtungsgästen ist zu beschränken und nur unter strengen Auflagen (sowohl für den Innen- als auch den Außenbereich) zu gestatten. Auflagen sind Besucherregistrierung mit Kontaktdaten, Reglementierung der Besucherzahl, Vorgaben für Mindestabstände zwischen Tischen von 2 Metern, Hygienemaßnahmen, Aushänge mit Hinweisen zu richtigen Hygienemaßnahmen etc. Restaurants und Speisegaststätten dürfen frühestens ab 6 Uhr öffnen und sind spätestens ab 15 Uhr zu schließen. Folgenden Geschäften ist bis weiteres auch die Öffnung an Sonn- und Feiertagen von 13 bis 18 Uhr gestattet (dies gilt nicht für Karfreitag, Ostersonntag und Ostermontag): Geschäften des Einzelhandels für Lebensmittel, Wochenmärkten, Abhol- und Lieferdiensten sowie Apotheken, außerdem Geschäften des Großhandels. Sämtliche Verkaufsstellen im Sinne des Ladenöffnungsgesetzes müssen die erforderlichen Maßnahmen zur Hygiene, zur Steuerung des Zutritts und zur Vermeidung von Warteschlagen treffen. Übernachtungsangebote dürfen nur zu nicht touristischen Zwecken genutzt werden. Veranstaltungen sind grundsätzlich untersagt. &nbsp; (Den Erlass mit allen angeordneten Maßnahmen finden Sie unter www.land.nrw/corona) &nbsp; Wirtschaftsgipfel der Landesregierung: Neben den gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen ist das Corona-Virus auch eine sehr ernste Herausforderung für die Wirtschaft in Nordrhein-Westfalen. Die Landesregierung hat dazu bereits viele Gespräche geführt und kurzfristige Maßnahmen für in Not geratene Unternehmen und ihre Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter auf den Weg gebracht. Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet, Wirtschafts- und Digitalminister Prof. Dr. Andreas Pinkwart sowie Finanzminister Lutz Lienenkämper werden sich am Donnerstag mit den Spitzen der nordrhein-westfälischen Wirtschaft und den Sozialpartnern in einer Videokonferenz austauschen. Ziel ist, die Unterstützungsprogramme weiter auszubauen und passgenaue finanzielle Hilfen für Betroffene bereitzustellen. An den Gesprächen nehmen auch Vertreterinnen und Vertreter der NRW.BANK sowie der Banken- und Sparkassenverbände teil.","2020-03-17","2020-04-25 12:13:43","2020-04-25 12:13:43","2020-04-25 12:13:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Library Catalog: www.land.nrw","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\Y4S4VANE\landesregierung-beschliesst-weitere-massnahmen-zur-pandemie-eindaemmung-soforthilfe.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

März 2020, weitere Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung der Corona-Virus-Pandemie beschlossen. &nbsp; Noch am Sonntag sollen durch Erlass des Ministeriums für Arbeit, Gesundheit und Soziales nahezu alle Freizeit-, Sport-, Unterhaltungs- und Bildungsangebote im Land eingestellt werden. So müssen bereits ab Montag alle so genannten „Amüsierbetriebe“ wie zum Beispiel Bars, Clubs, Diskotheken, Spielhallen, Theater, Kinos, Museen schließen. Eine gleiche Regelung ergeht für Prostitutionsbetriebe. &nbsp; Ab Dienstag ist dann auch der Betrieb von Fitness-Studios, Schwimm- und Spaßbädern sowie Saunen untersagt. Ebenso ab Dienstag sind Zusammenkünfte in Sportvereinen und sonstigen Sport- und Freizeiteinrichtungen sowie die Wahrnehmung von Angeboten in Volkshochschulen, Musikschulen und sonstigen öffentlichen und privaten Bildungseinrichtungen im außerschulischen Bereich nicht mehr gestattet. &nbsp; Der Zutritt zu Einrichtungshäusern und Einkaufszentren, „Shopping-malls“ oder „factory-out-lets“ soll nur zur Deckung des dringenden Bedarfs unter strengen Auflagen erlaubt sein – nicht zuletzt auch um zu vermeiden, dass sich Schülerinnen und Schüler nach den Schulschließungen ab Montag hier in größeren Gruppen versammeln. &nbsp; Die Schließungen und Auflagen sollen unabhängig von der jeweiligen Trägerschaft oder von den Eigentumsverhältnissen gelten. &nbsp; Damit die Versorgung mit Lebensmitteln, Bargeld, Bekleidung, Medikamenten und Dingen des täglichen Bedarfs sichergestellt ist, bleiben, Banken, Einzelhandelsbetriebe, insbesondere für Lebens- und Futtermittel, Apotheken und Drogerien geöffnet. Bibliotheken, Restaurants, Gaststätten und Hotels sollen in ihrem Betrieb an strenge Auflagen gebunden werden, die eine Verbreitung des Corona-Virus verhindern. &nbsp; Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet erklärt dazu: „Wir müssen in dieser ernsten Lage die notwendige Versorgung in vollem Umfang sicherstellen. Aber alle Freizeitaktivitäten und nicht unbedingt notwendige soziale Kontakte müssen unverzüglich vermieden werden. So sehr das für viele Menschen ein Opfer und eine Einschränkung bedeutet, so wichtig ist es jetzt, besonnen, aber auch entschlossen unser Leben zu entschleunigen.“ &nbsp; Die Regelungen sollen zunächst bis zum 19. April 2020 gelten, analog zu den bereits am Freitag verfügten Schließungen von Schulen und Kindertageseinrichtungen. Danach soll auf der Grundlage einer aktuellen Lage-Einschätzung des Robert-Koch-Instituts über das weitere Vorgehen entschieden werden.","2020-03-15","2020-04-25 12:15:22","2020-04-25 12:15:22","2020-04-25 12:15:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Library Catalog: www.land.nrw","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\TZHJVHTH\landesregierung-beschliesst-weitere-massnahmen-zur-eindaemmung-der-corona-virus.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NPII68M7","webpage","2020","","Sonderfahrplan für den nordrhein-westfälischen Schienenverkehr gilt ab Samstag | Das Landesportal Wir in NRW","","","","","/de/pressemitteilung/sonderfahrplan-fuer-den-nordrhein-westfaelischen-schienenverkehr-gilt-ab-samstag","Die Eisenbahnverkehrsunternehmen haben gemeinsam mit den Aufgabenträgern VRR, NVR und NWL einen Sonderfahrplan für den Schienenpersonennahverkehr in Nordrhein-Westfalen erarbeitet, der ab Samstag (21. März) schrittweise umgesetzt wird und vorerst bis 19. April 2020 gilt. Der neue Fahrplan führt zu einer deutlichen Reduzierung des Angebots auf den meisten Linien von S-Bahn, Regionalbahn und Regionalexpress. Insgesamt werden die Leistungen etwa um die Hälfte reduziert. Zugleich wird gewährleistet, dass ausreichend Fahrzeuge zum Einsatz kommen, um die Infektionsgefahr für die Fahrgäste möglichst gering zu halten. „Mit dem Sonderfahrplan stellen wir eine stabile Grundversorgung sicher. Menschen, die auf den Nahverkehr bei der Bahn angewiesen sind, bleiben damit mobil – trotz eines verringerten Angebots. Krankenschwestern, Pflegepersonal, Mitarbeiter von Polizei und Lebensmitteleinzelhandel müssen auch weiterhin zu ihren Arbeitsplätzen kommen“, sagte Verkehrsminister Hendrik Wüst. Wie in zahlreichen anderen Unternehmen sind auch die Eisenbahnverkehrsunternehmen von den Folgen der Pandemie betroffen und verzeichnen eine gestiegene Zahl von Krankheitsfällen und Mitarbeitern in Quarantäne. Deswegen ist die Reduktion des Angebots zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt richtig, weil der Sonderfahrplan geordnet umgesetzt werden kann.&nbsp; &nbsp; next prev 1 von 3 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Sonderfahrplan für den nordrhein-westfälischen Schienenverkehr gilt ab Samstag next prev 2 von 3 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Sonderfahrplan für den nordrhein-westfälischen Schienenverkehr gilt ab Samstag next prev 3 von 3 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Sonderfahrplan für den nordrhein-westfälischen Schienenverkehr gilt ab Samstag Zum Download öffnen Sie die Galerie bitte in der Mediathek. Fahrgäste finden alle aktuellen Informationen unter www.mobil.nrw. Die Eingabe der geänderten Fahrplanänderungen in die dynamischen Auskunftssysteme läuft auf Hochtouren. Bis alle Daten über die einschlägigen Apps und Webseiten der Verkehrsunternehmen und Verbünde in Nordrhein-Westfalen verfügbar sind, wird es aufgrund der Vielzahl der Änderungen aber einige Tage dauern. In der Zwischenzeit finden Fahrgäste unter www.mobil.nrw alle notwendigen Informationen. „Wir wollen die Fahrgäste in Nordrhein-Westfalen schnell und umfassend über alle Änderungen informieren. Dazu werden wir die Website in nächster Zeit mehrmals täglich aktualisieren“, sagt Birgit Strecker, Leiterin Kommunikation beim Kompetenzcenter Marketing NRW (KCM). Auch über die mobil.nrw-App wird auf die Sonderfahrpläne verwiesen und eine Integration in die dortige elektronische Fahrplanauskunft vorbereitet.","2020-03-20","2020-05-05 19:41:05","2020-05-05 19:41:09","2020-05-05 19:41:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Library Catalog: www.land.nrw","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\BURPR2YG\sonderfahrplan-fuer-den-nordrhein-westfaelischen-schienenverkehr-gilt-ab-samstag.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This independent examination may occur ‘in person’, ‘by other appropriate means’, or even, ‘due to the exigencies of the public health emergency’, not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that ‘the exigencies of the public health emergency’ might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist ‘no earlier than the day before’ the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals ‘consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor’. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise ‘necessary in the interest of the patient’. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days ‘of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary’. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide ‘a written statement’ rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team-working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.,                                        •               Many countries are enacting emergency mental health legislation owing to Covid-19.                                         •               In Ireland, the review process for involuntary psychiatry patients has been amended.                                         •               The proportionality of these changes will depend on implementation in practice.                                         •               Good communication, team-work and professional codes of practice and ethics are vital.","2020","2020-07-03 11:04:19","2020-07-03 11:04:19","2020-07-03 11:04:19","101564","","","70","","Int J Law Psychiatry","Emergency mental health legislation in response to the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic in Ireland","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 32482306 PMCID: PMC7174175","","; C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\J8J68BQT\Kelly - 2020 - Emergency mental health legislation in response to.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7174175/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By encouraging spending and stimulating the economy, the program will help Taiwan to turn crisis into opportunity and safely weather the coronavirus pandemic, the premier said. The voucher program comes as part of a barrage of government measures to stimulate and revive the economy, Premier Su said. Consumers can spend NT$1,000 to purchase vouchers worth NT$3,000, with the government making up the NT$2,000 difference. The program will therefore provide triple the stimulus effect of consumer spending alone, the premier said. The vouchers will be available to all 23 million Taiwanese nationals—from newborns to senior citizens—and approximately 150,000 foreign spouses with residency permits. They can be purchased through post offices, convenience stores, credit cards, stored value cards and mobile payment apps, and may be used for dining, travel, leisure or shopping expenses. With businesses now offering generous rewards and bonuses to compete for customers, NT$3,000 will go a long way toward achieving the government’s stimulus goals, Premier Su said. Consumers will be able to use the stimulus vouchers from July 15 through the end of the year, said Premier Su. Street vendors and small businesses receiving the vouchers as payment can then cash them at banks one week after receipt. Vendors will have until the end of March 2021 to complete all exchanges. The vouchers may be used to purchase many types of goods, including raw materials for business purposes. The consumer stimulus vouchers are aimed at addressing the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the premier emphasized. The initiative will hopefully alleviate people’s difficulties while solidifying Taiwan’s international reputation as a coronavirus success story and an oasis amid the chaos of the global pandemic.","2011-12-01","2020-12-04 15:06:24","2020-12-27 22:20:09","2020-12-04 15:06:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","zh-tw","行政院","text/html","","","","","Publisher: 2.16.886.101.20003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here's what you're still not allowed to do in Italy at the moment. Italy began to allow regional and some international travel on Wednesday June 3rd, and scrapped a 14-day mandatory quarantine period as it continues to ease lockdown measures. But not all the rules have been removed yet. Italy is now in phase two, which authorities say means &ldquo;living alongside the virus&rdquo;, with social distancing and other precautions expected to stay in place for some time. In fact there are quite a few things we still need to remember, according to the text of the most recent emergency decree. Each regional authority in Italy may adapt these rules and introduce additional measures, so it&rsquo;s advisable to check the latest updates on your local region&rsquo;s website if in doubt. Here are the national rules still in place:  One-metre distance rule Everyone is required to keep a minimum distance of one metre from anyone else at all times when out of the house, or two metres while exercising. If that&rsquo;s not possible, wearing masks is mandatory (for example when in shops and on public transport.) Wearing masks Wearing a face mask remain mandatory in closed spaces, such as in restaurants or shops, or on public transport. In some regions, including Lombardy, it&rsquo;s mandatory whenever you&rsquo;re out of the house. Quarantine While the national rules on quarantine for travellers have been dropped, some regions have their own requirements: Sicily, for example, is enforcing obligatory quarantine for anyone arriving from another region until June 8. Anyone with a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius or higher must stay at home. Temperature checks To access offices and public buildings it is mandatory to undergo body temperature measurement. If it exceeds 37.5 degrees, access may be denied. The government also recommends that restaurant owners should carry out these checks on customers at the entrance. Temperature screening is also in place for passengers at Italian airports and some train stations. Restrictions in your own vehicle Social distancing measures should be followed inside your own vehicle, too. Four people can travel in the same car only if they live in the same house. If you give someone a lift and you don&rsquo;t live with them, they must sit in the back seat, and both of you must wear masks. There are also restrictions on sharing a motorbike or scooter with anyone you don't live with. No gatherings Whether at home or outdoors, large gatherings and meetings of any type are still forbidden. No kissing and hugging This remains forbidden, even between relatives. Disposable gloves Despite being reportedly hard to find in some places, gloves are recommended when shopping and are mandatory in some food stores.Advance bookings: Reservations are required to enter museums and galleries, as well as restaurants, gyms, and beauty centres. Don&rsquo;t hang around In an effort to prevent crowds forming, particularly in the evening, bars and restaurants are instructed to ask customers not to linger at tables for too long. No nightclubs or cinemas The government hasn&rsquo;t yet said anything about when nightclubs might be able to reopen to the public. Some regions, such as Puglia, are planning to bring in their own rules to allow nightclubs and discos to reopen.  Cinemas and theatres are expected to reopen on June 15th."" *****More info on link below - http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioFaqNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&id=230","","2020-12-14 16:11:44","2020-12-14 16:11:52","2020-12-14 16:11:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Section: recommendation","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\8G5BLTTG\national-rules-in-place-for-italy-article-dated-4th-june-2020.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

August 2020 setzt Nordrhein-Westfalen die Regelungen und Maßnahmen in der angepassten Coronaschutzverordnung (CoronaSchVO) um. Gleichzeitig werden die&nbsp; Coronaverordnungen bis zum 15. September 2020 verlängert. Neben der Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse, um passgenau und noch schneller in betroffenen Kommunen auf ein erhöhtes lokales Infektionsgeschehen reagieren zu können, gelten ab 1. September 2020 neue Regeln für die Genehmigung von Veranstaltungen sowie in Schulen. Hierfür werden die Bestimmungen zur grundsätzlichen Maskenpflicht auf dem Schulgelände verlängert. Die zunächst vorsorglich eingeführte Pflicht, auch am Sitzplatz im Unterricht an weiterführenden und beruflichen Schulen eine Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung zu tragen, kann angesichts der Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens wie angekündigt mit Ablauf des 31. August 2020 auslaufen. &nbsp; Mit der Aktualisierung der Coronaschutzverordnung hat das Land Regelungen für eine lokale Corona-Bremse in die Verordnung aufgenommen. Danach gilt künftig folgende Regelung: Wenn die 7-Tage-Inzidenz in einem Kreis oder einer kreisfreien Stadt über 35 steigt, müssen die betroffenen Kommunen, das Landeszentrum Gesundheit Nordrhein-Westfalen (LZG.NRW) und die zuständige Bezirksregierung umgehend weitere passgenaue Schutzmaßnahmen zur Eindämmung des Infektionsgeschehens abstimmen und umsetzen. Hierdurch soll frühzeitig auf das lokale Infektionsgeschehen reagiert werden. Eine weitere Stufe wird bei einer 7-Tage-Inzidenz von 50 erreicht. Dann müssen unter Beteiligung des Gesundheitsministeriums weitere Maßnahmen abgestimmt und umgesetzt werden. &nbsp; Mit der Verlängerung der Coronaschutzverordnung regelt die Landesregierung zudem das Genehmigungsverfahren für Veranstaltungen neu. Klargestellt wird, dass bei Veranstaltungen ab 500 Teilnehmern der Veranstalter mit dem Hygiene- und Schutzkonzept auch eine pandemiegemäße An- und Abreise sicherstellen muss. Konzepte für Veranstaltungen mit über 1.000 Teilnehmern müssen nun nach Prüfung und Genehmigung des Hygienekonzeptes durch die Kommune zusätzlich auch dem Land vorgelegt werden. Das Ministerium für Arbeit, Gesundheit und Soziales (MAGS) kann dann sein Einverständnis geben oder dieses verweigern, wenn die Durchführung einer so großen Veranstaltung aufgrund des landesweiten Infektionsgeschehens mit dem Ziel der Eingrenzung dieses Geschehens nicht vereinbar ist. Großveranstaltungen bleiben bis zum 31. Dezember 2020 generell untersagt. next prev 1 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 2 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 3 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 4 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 5 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 6 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 7 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 8 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann next prev 9 von 9 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Nordrhein-Westfalen verlängert Coronaschutzverordnung: Einführung einer lokalen Corona-Bremse und klare Regeln für Schulen und Veranstaltungen Presse-Briefing mit Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann Zum Download öffnen Sie die Galerie bitte in der Mediathek. &nbsp; Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann: „Das dynamische Infektionsgeschehen der vergangenen Wochen hat gezeigt, dass wir wachsam sein müssen. Wir haben deswegen einen Mechanismus geschaffen, um auf kommunaler Ebene frühzeitig auf steigende Infektionszahlen reagieren zu können. Zusätzlich hat das Land nun auch die Möglichkeit, Veranstaltungen mit mehr als 1.000 Teilnehmern einen Riegel vorzuschieben, wenn das überregionale Infektionsgeschehen solche Events einfach nicht zulässt. Unser erklärtes Ziel ist, dass wir in der Frühphase das Virus eindämmen und so die Schließung von Kitas und Schulen und einen Lockdown des öffentlichen Lebens verhindern können. Auch deshalb richte ich nochmal den Appell an alle Bürgerinnen und Bürger: Bitte befolgen Sie weiterhin verantwortungsvoll die bestehenden Vorgaben und Regeln.“ Insgesamt sieht die angepasste Verordnung unter Berücksichtigung des Infektionsgeschehens keine wesentlichen neuen Öffnungen vor. Die klare Botschaft bleibt, dass die bestehenden Vorgaben einzuhalten sind. Deshalb wird das mit den anderen Ländern und dem Bund vereinbarte Mindestbußgeld von 50 Euro bei Verstößen gegen die Verpflichtung zum Tragen einer Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung eingeführt. In Nordrhein-Westfalen bleibt es zudem dabei, dass ein solcher Verstoß im ÖPNV mit einem Bußgeld von 150 Euro geahndet wird.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ebenfalls bis zum 15. September verlängert wird die Coronabetreuungsverordnung (CoronaBetrVO), die die Vorgaben zu Schul- und Kitabetrieb enthält. Die Bestimmungen zur grundsätzlichen Maskenpflicht im Schulgebäude und auf dem Schulgelände werden verlängert, die Pflicht, auch am Sitzplatz im Unterricht eine Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung zu tragen, kann hingegen auslaufen. Die Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens in Nordrhein-Westfalen und die bisherigen positiven Erfahrungen an den Schulen machen diesen Schritt möglich. Das Schutzkonzept für Schulen besteht aus drei Säulen: Hygienekonzepte, qualifizierte Rückverfolgbarkeit und Mund-Nasen-Schutz. Diese drei Säulen gelten weiterhin. &nbsp; Schul- und Bildungsministerin Yvonne Gebauer: „Die Maskenpflicht im Unterricht in weiterführenden Schulen war in den unsicheren Zeiten nach den Sommerferien mit deutlich erhöhtem und steigendem Infektionsgeschehen angezeigt. Sie war von Anfang an befristet auf den Zeitpunkt, an dem man eine belastbare Einschätzung zum Infektionsgeschehen nach der Reisesaison geben kann, also zwei Wochen nach Ende der Ferien. Knapp drei Wochen nach dem gelungenen Schulstart entwickeln sich die Infektionszahlen in Nordrhein-Westfalen glücklicherweise positiv, sodass wir die Maskenpflicht im Unterricht aussetzen können. Eine Maske muss nur noch getragen werden, wenn die Schülerinnen und Schüler ihren festen Sitzplatz verlassen. Dies ist eine spürbare Erleichterung. Aber wir bleiben wachsam und im intensiven Austausch mit den Akteuren der Schulpolitik und den Schulen selbst. Zugleich behalten wir die strengen Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzmaßnahmen an unseren Schulen konsequent bei, um alle am Schulleben weiterhin bestmöglich zu schützen. Unser Konzept für einen angepassten Schulbetrieb in Corona-Zeiten greift und bietet Möglichkeiten, auf die Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens angemessen zu reagieren.” Schulen können sich im Einvernehmen mit der Schulgemeinde darauf verständigen, freiwillig auch weiterhin im Unterricht eine Mund-Nase-Bedeckung zu tragen. &nbsp; Bei der Coronaeinreiseverordnung bleiben die Regelungen zunächst weitestgehend unverändert. Die Testpflicht und das Meldeverfahren ergeben sich hier ohnehin unmittelbar aus den Vorgaben des Bundesgesundheitsministeriums. Änderungen soll es hier erst Mitte September geben. Bis dahin harmonisiert das Land seine Regelungen lediglich leicht im Hinblick auf Grenzpendler und auf die Erfüllung der Meldepflicht durch Ausfüllen der sogenannten Aussteigerkarten. &nbsp; Die Änderungen in allen Verordnungen treten am Dienstag, 1. September 2020, in Kraft. &nbsp; Die wichtigsten Änderungen im Überblick: &nbsp; Rechtliche Verankerung des Infektionsgeschehen-Monitorings (neuer § 15a) &nbsp; Es wird rechtlich verankert, dass die Gesundheitsämter mit Unterstützung des Landeszentrum Gesundheit Nordrhein-Westfalen (LZG) fortlaufend das lokale, regionale und landesweite Infektionsgeschehen beobachten, wobei die 7-Tage-Inzidenz ein wesentlicher Indikator ist. Sobald die 7-Tage-Inzidenz in einem Kreis oder einer kreisfreien Stadt über 35 steigt, müssen die betroffenen Kommunen, das LZG und die zuständige Bezirksregierung umgehend weitere konkrete Schutzmaßnahmen zur Eindämmung des Infektionsgeschehens abstimmen und umsetzen. Wenn das Infektionsgeschehen nicht ausschließlich auf bestimmte Einrichtungen oder ähnliches zurückzuführen und einzugrenzen ist, können dabei auch über diese Verordnung hinausgehende Schutzmaßnahmen angeordnet werden. Ab einer 7-Tage-Inzidenz von 50 sind zwingend zusätzliche Schutzmaßnahmen anzuordnen. In diesen Fällen muss auch das Gesundheitsministerium in die Beratungen einbezogen werden. &nbsp; Umgang mit Veranstaltungen (Änderungen in den §§ 2b) Über die bisherigen Vorgaben hinaus muss das Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzept bei Veranstaltungen mit mehr als 500 teilnehmenden Personen auch darlegen, wie die An- und Abreise der Personen unter Einhaltung der Belange des Infektionsschutzes erfolgt. Wie bisher muss das Konzept zudem darlegen, wie der Mindestabstand von 1,5 Metern eingehalten und die besondere Infektionshygiene (durch angepasste Reinigungsintervalle, ausreichende Handdesinfektionsgelegenheiten, Informationstafeln zum infektionsschutzgerechten Verhalten usw.) gewährleistet werden. Neu ist auch: Bei Veranstaltungen mit mehr als 1.000 Teilnehmern müssen die Kommunen vor der Erteilung der Genehmigung das Einverständnis des Gesundheitsministeriums einholen. Das bedeutet: Die lokalen Behörden zeigen dem Gesundheitsministerium die Veranstaltungen an, bei denen sie der Ansicht sind, dass das Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzept in Ordnung ist, so dass sie die Veranstaltung normalerweise genehmigen würden. Das Gesundheitsministerium kann das Einverständnis verweigern, wenn die Durchführung einer solchen Veranstaltung im Hinblick auf die Teilnehmerzahl trotz eines von den örtlichen Behörden positiv geprüften Hygienekonzeptes aufgrund ihrer überregionalen Bedeutung für das Infektionsgeschehen mit dem Ziel der Eingrenzung des Infektionsgeschehens nicht vereinbar ist. Das Gesundheitsministerium kann eine bereits erteilte Genehmigung jederzeit widerrufen, wenn das Infektionsgeschehen durch steigende Infektionszahlen oder aus anderen Gründen eine Durchführung nicht mehr vertretbar erscheinen lässt. Diese Regelungen gelten für alle Veranstaltungen, die ab dem 12. September 2020 stattfinden, um den Behörden die Umstellung des Verfahrens zu ermöglichen. Großveranstaltungen bleiben bis zum 31. Dezember 2020 generell untersagt. Der Begriff „Großveranstaltung“ bezieht sich dabei nicht auf die Personenzahl, sondern auf die Infektionsrelevanz der Veranstaltung (Schützenfeste, Straßenfeste, Musikfestivals etc.). Zur Durchführung von Weihnachtsmärkten finden aktuell Gespräche des zuständigen Gesundheitsministeriums auf der Grundlage von dazu eingereichten Hygienekonzepten statt.&nbsp; &nbsp; Betriebsausflüge und Betriebsfeiern Die Regeln der bislang untersagten Betriebsausflüge und Betriebsfeiern werden an die Regelungen für den privaten Bereich angeglichen. Künftig sind Versammlungen, Zusammenkünfte und Veranstaltungen in Unternehmen, Betrieben und Behörden, die aus sozial-kommunikativen Anlässen erfolgen, unter den gleichen Voraussetzungen und Einschränkungen erlaubt, die auch für den privaten Bereich gelten. &nbsp; Coronabetreuungsverordnung Es besteht weiterhin Maskenpflicht im Schulgebäude und auf dem gesamten Schulgelände. Die vorläufig bis zum 31. August 2020 geltende Pflicht, ab Klasse 5 grundsätzlich auch im Unterricht eine Maske zu tragen, hingegen wird für das Sitzen an einem festen Sitzplatz aufgehoben. Es besteht eine feste Sitzordnung im Unterricht zur Gewährleistung der Rückverfolgbarkeit. &nbsp; Die entsprechenden Verordnungen werden im Laufe des Tages auf www.land.nrw veröffentlicht. &nbsp;","2020-08-31","2021-01-21 16:50:45","2021-01-21 16:50:45","2021-01-21 16:50:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\3NRU7EZ9\nordrhein-westfalen-verlaengert-coronaschutzverordnung-einfuehrung-einer-lokalen.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"DURZ4U98","webpage","2020","","Corona-Schutzverordnung verlängert | Das Landesportal Wir in NRW","","","","","/de/pressemitteilung/nordrhein-westfalen-verlaengert-corona-schutzverordnung-mehr-zuschauer-bei","Das Landeskabinett hat am Dienstag, 15. September 2020, die Verlängerung der Coronaverordnungen bis einschließlich 30. September 2020 beschlossen. Veränderungen gibt es vornehmlich im Bereich des Sports: hier sind in allen Bereichen wieder mehr Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauer in den Sportstätten zugelassen. Außerdem haben sich die Länder angesichts der besonderen Herausforderungen bei Mannschaftswettbewerben mit entsprechendem Faninteresse auf eine gemeinsame Vorgehensweise bei der Frage nach Zuschauern bei bundesweiten Teamsportveranstaltungen und damit auch bei Bundesligaspielen geeinigt. Für einen zunächst sechs Wochen dauernden Probebetrieb sollen bundesweite Teamsportveranstaltungen wieder mit Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauern stattfinden können, wenn strenge Regeln für den Hygiene- und Infektionsschutz eingehalten werden. &nbsp; Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet: „Wir haben eine klare Entscheidung zu den Rahmenbedingungen für die vielen tausenden Sportvereine in Nordrhein-Westfalen versprochen. Sportveranstaltungen leben von der Unterstützung der Fans, von der Atmosphäre mit Publikum – das gilt sowohl für Bundesligaspiele, als auch für den Amateur- und Breitensport. Deshalb haben wir den Austausch mit dem Amateursport gesucht und uns im Länderkreis für eine zügige, einheitliche Lösung zu bundesweiten Sportveranstaltungen eingesetzt. Beides setzen wir heute in geltendes Recht um und schaffen damit ein weiteres Stück verantwortungsvolle Normalität. Mit sicheren Infektionsschutzkonzepten und Grenzen bei der Kapazität können die Vereine ihre Sportstätten jetzt endlich wieder mit Leben füllen. Dabei gilt: Hygienekonzepte, Schutzmaßnahmen und ein umsichtiges Vorgehen haben Priorität.“ &nbsp; Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann: „Der Sport wurde in den letzten Monaten auf eine harte Probe gestellt. Allen ist bewusst, dass der Sport von seinen Zuschauern und der Stimmung in den Stadien lebt. Viele haben das schmerzlich vermisst. Genauso klar ist auch: Der Infektionsschutz und damit der Schutz von Gesundheit muss oberste Priorität haben. Daher tasten wir uns jetzt vorsichtig an eine Wiederzulassung einer begrenzten Zahl an Zuschauern heran. Allerdings nur, wenn das regionale Infektionsgeschehen beachtet und besondere Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzmaßnahmen sichergestellt werden. Das wird für alle Beteiligten sicherlich eine neue Herausforderung. Wir haben die Herausforderungen bisher alles in allem sehr gut gemeistert. Und ich bin zuversichtlich, dass uns das auch in diesem Fall gelingen kann, wenn sich jeder Zuschauer diszipliniert und verantwortungsbewusst an die besonderen Auflagen vor Ort hält.“ &nbsp; Neue Regeln für Sportveranstaltungen Ab dem 16. September 2020 dürfen bei Sportveranstaltungen oder bei Wettbewerben wieder mehr als 300 Zuschauer anwesend sein, sofern ein besonderes Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzept vorgelegt wird. Bei mehr als 1.000 Zuschauern gilt – wie auch bei sonstigen Veranstaltungen – eine Obergrenze von einem Drittel der Kapazität der Sportstätte. Auch die Regelung zur Anzahl von Teilnehmenden bei nicht kontaktfreiem Sport wurde zugunsten von Sportarten mit außergewöhnlichen Mannschaftsgrößen dahingehend erweitert, dass nun alle Spielerinnen oder Spieler, die die jeweilige Sportart erfordert, am Spiel teilnehmen können – auch wenn sie die Höchstzahl von 30 überschreitet. Damit setzt die Landesregierung um, was in der vergangenen Woche bei einem gemeinsamen Gipfel mit Vertreterinnen und Vertretern von Sportvereinen und Verbänden beschlossen wurde. Besondere Regelungen gelten im Rahmen eines Probebetriebes für bundesweite Teamsportveranstaltungen. &nbsp; Länder-Einigung für bundesweite Teamsportveranstaltungen Die Länder haben sich heute auf folgende Eckpunkte für die Zulassung von Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauer bei Bundesliga-Spielen und anderen bundesweiten Teamsportwettbewerben geeinigt: &nbsp; In einem sechswöchigen Probetrieb sollen die Hygienekonzepte, die als Grundlage für die Zulassung von Zuschauern bei bundesweiten Sportveranstaltungen dienen, getestet werden. Das aktuelle Pandemiegeschehen wird berücksichtigt. So werden keine Zuschauer zu Veranstaltungen zugelassen, wenn die 7-Tages-Inzidenz pro 100.000 Einwohner am Austragungsort größer gleich 35 und das Infektionsgeschehen nicht klar eingrenzbar ist. Das Abstandsgebot von 1,5 Metern muss durch eine Reduktion der maximalen Zuschauerauslastung, eine Entzerrung der Besucherströme bei Ein- und Auslass und durch ein Verbot des Ausschanks und Konsums von Alkohol gewährleistet werden. Das Tragen einer Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung bis zum Einnehmen des Sitz- oder Stehplatzes ist Pflicht. Für ausreichende Lüftung der Veranstaltungsorte muss gesorgt werden. Die zulässige Zuschauerzahl wird für jeden Austragungsort individuell bestimmt. Zulässige Höchstkapazität während des sechswöchigen Probebetriebs sind bei mehr als 1.000 Zuschauern 20 Prozent der jeweiligen Stadien- oder Hallenkapazität. &nbsp; Die Änderungen in allen Verordnungen des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen treten am Mittwoch, 16. September 2020, in Kraft. &nbsp;","2020-09-15","2021-01-21 16:21:38","2021-01-21 16:21:38","2021-01-21 16:21:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\FBHZZHI6\nordrhein-westfalen-verlaengert-corona-schutzverordnung-mehr-zuschauer-bei.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

August verlängert | Das Landesportal Wir in NRW","","","","","/de/pressemitteilung/klare-regeln-fuer-den-einstieg-nach-der-sommerpause-coronaschutzverordnung-wird-bis","Die Coronaschutzverordnung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen wird bis zum 31. August 2020 verlängert und der Verstoß gegen die Maskenpflicht in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln als Ordnungswidrigkeit aufgenommen. Ein solcher Verstoß wird ab sofort unmittelbar mit 150 Euro geahndet. Ebenfalls einheitlich bis zum 31. August 2020 verlängert wird die Coronabetreuungsverordnung, die den Vorgaben zu Schul- und Kitabetrieb Rechnung trägt. Insbesondere werden die bereits kommunizierten Bestimmungen zur Maskenpflicht auf dem Schulgelände festgeschrieben. In der ebenfalls bis zum 31. August 2020 fortgeschriebenen Coronaeinreiseverordnung werden einige Klarstellungen vorgenommen. Alle neuen Verordnungen treten ab Mittwoch, 12. August, in Kraft. &nbsp; Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann: „Zum Ende der Reisesaison haben wir in Nordrhein-Westfalen ein dynamisches Infektionsgeschehen mit steigenden Infektionszahlen. Vor dem Hintergrund stehen weitere Öffnungen derzeit nicht zur Debatte. Mit dieser Situation verantwortungsvoll umzugehen, ist eine Gemeinschaftsaufgabe. Daher appelliere ich erneut an die Bürgerinnen und Bürger: Egal ob am See, im Biergarten oder im ÖPNV. Halten Sie sich an die bestehenden Regelungen. Halten Sie Abstand, tragen Sie einen Mund-Nase-Schutz und beachten Sie die üblichen Hygieneregeln.“ &nbsp; Verkehrsminister Hendrik Wüst: „Das Tragen der Maske ist eine Frage der Solidarität mit den Schwächsten in unserer Gesellschaft. Die Masken-Pflicht im ÖPNV ist eine kleine Unannehmlichkeit, sie kann aber eine große Katastrophe verhindern.“ &nbsp; Die Änderungen in den Verordnungen im Überblick: &nbsp; Coronaschutzverordnung Der Verstoß gegen die Maskenpflicht in öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln wurde aufgenommen. Ein solcher Verstoß stellt unmittelbar eine Ordnungswidrigkeit dar und wird nicht – wie bisher – erst nach einer zusätzlichen Aufforderung geahndet. Ab sofort gilt ein Bußgeld in Höhe von 150 Euro. Coronabetreuungsverordnung Es besteht Maskenpflicht auf dem gesamten Schulgelände und vorläufig bis zum 31. August ab Klasse 5 grundsätzlich auch im Unterricht. Ausnahmen gibt es in bestimmten Fällen, wenn der Mindestabstand von 1,5 Metern gewährleistet ist. Es besteht eine feste Sitzordnung im Unterricht zur Gewährleistung der Rückverfolgbarkeit. Ab 17. August 2020 nehmen die Kindertagesbetreuungsangebote den Regelbetrieb in der Pandemie auf und es gilt wieder der vertraglich vereinbarte Betreuungsumfang. Bewährte pädagogische Konzepte können wieder umgesetzt werden. Es gelten allerdings die genannten Hygiene- und Schutzmaßnahmen. Coronaeinreiseverordnung Die vollständige Freistellung von der Verpflichtung, sich in Quarantäne zur begeben, ist für Personen, die sich zur Erledigung diplomatischer oder konsularischer Aufgaben oder zwingender beruflicher Angelegenheiten oder zur Ablegung oder Vorbereitung von ausbildungs- oder studienbezogenen Prüfungen im Bundesgebiet aufhalten, nun an die Voraussetzung geknüpft, dass der Aufenthalt nicht länger als 72 Stunden dauert. Darüber hinaus gilt weiterhin: Die geltende Coronaeinreiseverordnung für Nordrhein-Westfalen verpflichtet Personen, die sich innerhalb der letzten 14 Tage in einem vom RKI benannten Risikogebiet aufgehalten haben sich grundsätzlich unverzüglich nach ihrer Wiedereinreise in eine 14-tägige Absonderung in der eigenen Häuslichkeit oder einer anderen geeigneten Unterkunft zu begeben und sich beim zuständigen Gesundheitsamt zu melden. Definierte Ausnahmen sind vorgesehen. Zuwiderhandlungen werden als Ordnungswidrigkeiten behandelt. Die Quarantäne entfällt erst bei Vorliegen einer negativen Testung auf COVID-19.

"Q48IKB52","webpage","2020","","Regelbetrieb der Kindertagesbetreuung | Das Landesportal Wir in NRW","","","","","/de/pressemitteilung/regelbetrieb-der-kindertagesbetreuung-der-pandemie","Nordrhein-Westfalen setzt seinen stufenweisen, verantwortungsvollen Kurs in der Kindertagesbetreuung fort. Ab dem 17. August erfolgt die Rückkehr in den Regelbetrieb in der Kindertagesbetreuung unter den Bedingungen der Pandemie. Alle Kinder können dann – unter ständiger Berücksichtigung des Infektionsgeschehens, der Bedürfnisse der Kinder, der Interessen der Beschäftigten und der Belange der Familien – ihre Kindertageseinrichtung oder Kindertagespflege wieder im vertraglich vereinbarten Umfang besuchen. Für den Kita-Alltag bedeutet das vor allem, dass bewährte pädagogische Konzepte wieder umgesetzt werden können. next prev 1 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Regelbetrieb der Kindertagesbetreuung in der Pandemie Presse-Briefing next prev 2 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Regelbetrieb der Kindertagesbetreuung in der Pandemie Presse-Briefing next prev 3 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Regelbetrieb der Kindertagesbetreuung in der Pandemie Presse-Briefing next prev 4 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Regelbetrieb der Kindertagesbetreuung in der Pandemie Presse-Briefing next prev 5 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Regelbetrieb der Kindertagesbetreuung in der Pandemie Presse-Briefing Zum Download öffnen Sie die Galerie bitte in der Mediathek. &nbsp; Familienminister Joachim Stamp: „Die Beschäftigten in der Kindertagesbetreuung und die Familien haben in den letzten Monaten einen unvorstellbaren Kraftakt gestemmt. Für das großartige Engagement und die Flexibilität aller Beteiligten bedanke ich mich herzlich. Für mich stand immer fest, dass der Schutz aller, der Beschäftigten in den Kindertageseinrichtungen und der Kindertagespflegepersonen, der Kinder und Eltern gewährleistet sein und daher jeder Öffnungsschritt wohlüberlegt sein muss. Nach Erörterung mit allen Beteiligten halten wir es für verantwortbar, das volle Regelangebot zu machen. Zum 17. August gehen wir – allerdings weiterhin unter Vorbehalt des Infektionsgeschehens – wieder in den Regelbetrieb. Klar ist: Dies bleibt ein Regelbetrieb in der Pandemie.“ &nbsp; Grundsätzlich ist klar: Je nach Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens, Empfehlungen des RKI oder weiteren wissenschaftlichen und empirischen Erkenntnissen kann es aber auch immer zu erneuten Einschränkungen kommen. Auch landesweite Regelungen können derzeit nicht ausgeschlossen werden. &nbsp; Dieser weitere Öffnungsschritt ist im Vorfeld mit Trägern und Kommunen, Gewerkschaften, Kinderärztinnen und -ärzten beraten worden. Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse wurden dabei ebenso berücksichtigt wie die Erfahrungen aus dem eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb. In enger Absprache mit den Trägern und Kommunen hat das Ministerium sich darauf verständigt, nicht unmittelbar mit dem Ende der Sommerferien den Regelbetrieb aufzunehmen, sondern am 17. August zu starten. &nbsp; Familienminister Joachim Stamp: „Die Landesregierung ist damit dem Wunsch der Träger und Kommunen nachgekommen, damit allen Einrichtungen, auch denen, die ihre Ferienschließzeiten in der zweiten Schulferienhälfte haben, genug Vorbereitungszeit für den Übergang in den Regelbetrieb eingeräumt wird.“ &nbsp; In der Kindertagesbetreuung können wesentliche Schutzmaßnahmen, die außerhalb der Kindertagesbetreuung gelten, nicht umgesetzt werden. Die Einhaltung des Abstandsgebots von Kindern untereinander sowie zwischen Kindern und pädagogischem Personal oder Kindertagespflegepersonen ist nicht möglich. Auch das Tragen von Mund-Nasen-Bedeckungen ist für Kinder nicht umsetzbar. Daher ist die Umsetzung von Hygienemaßnahmen in der Kindertagesbetreuung weiter von besonderer Bedeutung. Die allgemeinen Schutzmaßnahmen, die die Ausbreitung des Virus verhindern sollen, gelten weiterhin und werden gesondert geregelt. Das betrifft das Abstandsgebot zwischen den Erwachsenen, das Tragen von Mund-Nasen-Bedeckungen bei Erwachsenen, wenn der Abstand nicht eingehalten werden kann und die Gewährleistung der Nachverfolgbarkeit möglichen Infektionsgeschehens und besondere Hygienemaßnahmen. &nbsp; Um den Bedürfnissen des Gesundheitsschutzes der Beschäftigten nachzukommen und für mehr Sicherheit im Umgang mit dem Corona-Virus zu sorgen, hat das Land beschlossen, dass alle Beteiligten sofort und umfänglich getestet werden, wenn vor Ort in der Kindertagesbetreuung ein Infektionsgeschehen auftritt. Zusätzlich können sich alle Beschäftigten in der Kindertagesbetreuung und die Kindertagespflegepersonen bis zu den Herbstferien freiwillig alle 14 Tage testen lassen. Die Kosten dafür übernimmt das Land. Sollte bei diesen Testungen eine Infektion festgestellt werden, werden von den Gesundheitsämtern weitere Maßnahmen ergriffen. &nbsp; Um den gestiegenen Anforderungen zur Umsetzung der Hygienevorgaben (Desinfektion, Händewaschen, Essenszubereitung, Einhaltung von Abständen) Rechnung zu tragen, erhalten die Träger von Kindertageseinrichtungen kurzfristig finanzielle Unterstützung. Die Leistungen sollen insbesondere der Finanzierung zusätzlicher Hilfskräfte im nichtpädagogischen Bereich sowie der Entlastung der Träger für die nicht vorhersehbaren gesteigerten Kosten für Arbeitsschutz- und Hygieneausrüstung dienen. &nbsp; Familienminister Stamp: „Die Kita-Helferinnen und -Helfer entlasten das pädagogische Personal bei einfachen, alltäglichen Arbeiten. Sie sind kein Ersatz für unser pädagogisches Personal, sondern eine Unterstützung im Kita-Alltag. Die pädagogische Betreuung und frühkindliche Bildung wird von unseren Fachkräften geleistet.“ Das Programm des Landes ist zunächst bis zum Jahresende vorgesehen. &nbsp; Rechtliche Vorgaben für den Regelbetrieb ab dem 17. August: Die rechtlichen Regelungen des Achten Sozialgesetzbuches (SGB VIII) und des Kinderbildungsgesetzes (KiBiz) gelten uneingeschränkt. &nbsp; Es gelten die allgemeinen Schutzmaßnahmen, die die Ausbreitung von SARS-CoV-2 verhindern sollen und gesondert geregelt werden. Für den Einsatz des Personals in Kindertageseinrichtungen ist die neue Personalverordnung anzuwenden, die sich derzeit in der abschließenden Abstimmung befindet. Sie soll zeitnah im August veröffentlicht werden. Die vorzunehmende individuelle Risikobewertung im Rahmen einer arbeitsmedizinischen Begutachtung kann zu eingeschränkten Personalressourcen im pädagogischen Alltag der Kindertagesbetreuung führen. Um diese besondere Situation zu berücksichtigen, sieht die Personalverordnung eine befristete Öffnung bzw. die Möglichkeit von Abweichungen bestehender Standards vor. &nbsp; Für die Umsetzung bedeutet dies: &nbsp; Die „Handreichung für die Kindertagesbetreuung in einem eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb nach Maßgaben des Infektionsschutzes aufgrund der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie“ findet ab dem 17. August 2020 keine Anwendung mehr. Die Vorgaben der Betriebserlaubnis sind einzuhalten. Die für den Regelbetrieb vorgesehenen pädagogischen Konzepte können wieder umgesetzt werden. Die Kinder werden wieder in dem vertraglich vereinbarten Betreuungsumfang betreut. Sollte der personelle Mindeststandard in einer Kindertageseinrichtung nicht eingehalten werden können, so ist dieser Umstand, wie im Regelbetrieb ansonsten auch, vom Träger dem jeweiligen Landesjugendamt nach § 47 SGB VIII anzuzeigen und Lösungen für die bestmögliche Aufrechterhaltung des Betreuungsbetriebs zu entwickeln. Soweit nicht anders möglich, kann es hier zu Einschränkungen in der Betreuung kommen. Alle Erwachsenen haben einen Mindestabstand von 1,5 Metern zueinander einzuhalten. Das gilt für die Beschäftigten in den Kindertageseinrichtungen und für Kindertagespflegepersonen untereinander, zwischen den Beschäftigten bzw. Kindertagespflegepersonen und den Eltern und den Beschäftigten in den Kindertageseinrichtungen bzw. Kindertagespflegepersonen und Externen. Im Umgang mit anderen Erwachsenen muss immer dann eine Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung getragen werden, wenn der Abstand von 1,5 Metern nicht einzuhalten ist. Eine Rückverfolgbarkeit von möglicherweise eintretendem Infektionsgeschehen muss weiterhin gewährleistet werden. Notwendige Hygienemaßnahmen sind weiterhin umzusetzen. &nbsp;Umfassende Informationen und Empfehlungen finden Sie hier.","2020-07-28","2021-01-21 16:17:48","2021-01-21 16:17:48","2021-01-21 16:17:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\NSPJ3CS5\regelbetrieb-der-kindertagesbetreuung-der-pandemie.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Juni 2020, treten in Nordrhein-Westfalen weitere Anpassungen der Corona-Schutzmaßnahmen in Kraft. Diese betreffen neben Erleichterungen für die flächenmäßige Zutrittsbegrenzung im Handel unter anderem Veranstaltungen und Versammlungen mit mehr als 100 Zuschauern, die unter Auflagen insbesondere zur Rückverfolgung der Teilnehmer wieder möglich sind. Auch private Feste aus herausragendem Anlass wie Jubiläen, Hochzeits-, Tauf-, Geburtstags- oder Abschlussfeiern können mit maximal 50 Teilnehmern unter Auflagen zur Rückverfolgung und Hygiene- und Schutzvorkehrungen wieder stattfinden. Des Weiteren können Bars sowie Wellnesseinrichtungen und Erlebnisbäder ihren Betrieb unter Auflagen aufnehmen. Erleichterungen gelten auch für den Kontaktsport. Die Ausübung von nicht-kontaktfreien Sportarten ist ab Montag auch in geschlossenen Räumen für Gruppen bis zu zehn Personen, im Freien für Gruppen bis zu 30 Personen wieder zulässig. Sportwettbewerbe im Breiten- und Freizeitsport können unter Auflagen auch in Hallen wieder stattfinden. Die grundsätzlichen Regelungen zur Kontaktbeschränkung im öffentlichen Raum und die Verpflichtung zum Tragen einer Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung in bestimmten Bereichen mit Publikums- und Kundenverkehr bleiben bestehen. Auch Großveranstaltungen bleiben bis mindestens 31. August 2020 untersagt. Die positive Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens in Nordrhein-Westfalen macht die weiteren Anpassungen der Coronaschutzmaßnahmen möglich. So ist die Zahl der Neuinfektionen in Nordrhein-Westfalen seit den ersten Öffnungen am 20. April um mehr als 75 Prozent zurückgegangen. Diese Entwicklung bestärkt die Landesregierung in ihrem Kurs in der Corona-Pandemie. Das verantwortliche und rücksichtsvolle Verhalten der deutlichen Mehrheit der Menschen erlaubt es, diese weiteren Schritte auf dem Weg in eine verantwortungsvolle&nbsp;Normalität zu gehen. Die maßvollen Öffnungen und Anpassungen der Schutzmaßnahmen finden unter stetiger Evaluierung des Infektionsgeschehens statt. Die neue Fassung der Coronaschutz-Verordnung tritt am Montag, 15. Juni 2020, in Kraft und gilt vorerst bis zum 1. Juli 2020. Sie ist auf www.land.nrw abrufbar. Die neuen Regelungen im Einzelnen Folgende Neuerungen sieht die angepasste Corona-Schutzverordnung für Nordrhein-Westfalen ab dem 15. Juni 2020 vor: 1. Veranstaltungen und Festveranstaltungen Veranstaltungen Veranstaltungen und Versammlungen mit bis zu 100 Personen sind unter Auflagen zu Abstands- und Schutzvorkehrungen erlaubt. Hier gelten Regelungen zur Hygiene, zur Steuerung des Zutritts, zur Gewährleistung eines Mindestabstands von 1,5 Metern sowie zur Rückverfolgbarkeit der Zuschauer und Teilnehmer. Für Veranstaltungen mit mehr als 100 Zuschauern gelten erweitere Anforderungen. Diese sind nur in Abstimmung mit der entsprechenden Gesundheitsbehörde zulässig. Zudem bedürfen sie eines besonderen Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzeptes. Bei Veranstaltungen mit festen Sitzplätzen kann bei Erstellung von Sitzplänen und Sicherstellung der Rückverfolgung der Teilnehmer die Abstandsregelung von 1,5 Meter entfallen. Das gilt auch für außerschulische Bildungsangebote oder kulturelle Veranstaltungen, wenn feste Sitzplätze gegeben sind. Die Vorgaben zur Rückverfolgbarkeit sehen die Erfassung der Daten der Teilnehmer sowie die Erstellung eines Sitzplans vor, der erfasst, wo welche anwesende Person gegessen hat. Große Festveranstaltungen wie Volksfeste, Stadt-, Dorf- und Straßenfeste, Schützen- und Weinfeste oder ähnliche Festveranstaltungen bleiben weiterhin bis mindestens zum 31. August 2020 untersagt. Das gilt auch für Musikfeste, Festivals und ähnliche Kulturveranstaltungen sowie Sportfeste. Private Festveranstaltungen Veranstaltungen mit vornehmlich geselligem Charakter bleiben weiterhin untersagt. Ausnahmen gelten für Feste aus herausragendem Anlass wie Jubiläen, Hochzeits-, Tauf-, Geburtstags- oder Abschlussfeiern, die unter Auflagen wieder stattfinden können. Diese Festveranstaltungen sind mit höchstens 50 Teilnehmern möglich, wenn Hygieneregeln beachtet werden und die Teilnehmer im Sinne einer Rückverfolgung erfasst sind. Unter diesen Voraussetzungen kann etwa bei standesamtlichen Trauungen oder dem Zusammenkommen nach einer Beerdigung auf das Tragen einer Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung verzichtet werden. Diese Feiern können in abgetrennten Räumlichkeiten auch in gastronomischen Einrichtungen und Hotels wieder stattfinden. 2. Handel, Museen und GastronomieErleichterungen gelten ab 15. Juni auch für die flächenmäßige Zutrittsbegrenzung im Handel. Diese wird von einer Person pro zehn Quadratmeter auf eine Person pro sieben Quadratmeter der Verkaufsfläche des Ladengeschäfts erweitert. Dies gilt auch für die Besucherbegrenzungen in Museen und Ausstellungen sowie in Zoos und Tierparks. Bars können nach den für die übrige Gastronomie geltenden Maßgaben für Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzstandards ihren Betrieb wieder aufnehmen. Clubs und Diskotheken bleiben weiterhin geschlossen. Auch Prostitutionstätten, Bordellen und ähnlichen Einrichtungen bleibt der Betrieb weiterhin untersagt. 3. Erholungs- und Freizeiteinrichtungen Das Grillen ist auf öffentlichen Plätzen oder Anlagen ab 15. Juni wieder möglich. Floh- und Trödelmärkte können unter Auflagen eines besonderes Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzepts stattfinden. Auch vorübergehende Freizeitparks aus einer Mehrzahl von Schaustellerbetrieben können unter Auflagen eines besonderes Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzepts und in Abstimmung mit den zuständigen Behörden zugelassen werden. Wellnesseinrichtungen und Saunabetriebe können ihren Betrieb unter Auflagen der Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzstandards wieder aufnehmen. Dasselbe gilt für Erlebnis- und Spaßbäder. Die Nutzungsbegrenzung auf Bahnenschwimmbecken entfällt. 4. Sport Die Ausübung von nicht-kontaktfreien Sportarten ist ab Montag auch in geschlossenen Räumen für Gruppen bis zu zehn Personen, Verwandte in gerader Linie oder Angehörige von zwei Haushalten wieder möglich. Im Freien kann Kontaktsport in Gruppen bis zu 30 Personen stattfinden. In beiden Fällen muss eine Rückverfolgbarkeit der Teilnehmer durch Datenerfassung sichergestellt werden. Auch Wettbewerbe im Breiten- und Freizeitsport sind unter Einhaltung eines Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzepts auch in geschlossenen Räumen und Hallen wieder zulässig.","2020-06-11","2021-01-21 15:34:39","2021-01-21 15:34:39","2021-01-21 15:34:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\VRYMS7EL\neue-fassung-der-corona-schutzverordnung-mit-weiteren-erleichterungen-gilt-ab.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mai 2020, gelten in Nordrhein-Westfalen im Zuge des Nordrhein-Westfalen-Plans der Landesregierung weitere Öffnungen der Anti-Corona-Maßnahmen. Dazu gehören unter anderem die Öffnung der Kontaktbeschränkung auf Gruppen von bis zu zehn Personen entsprechend der jüngsten Verständigung zwischen Bund und Ländern, Regelungen zur Durchführung von Veranstaltungen in Kinos, Theatern, Opern- und Konzerthäusern und anderen öffentlichen oder privaten Kultureinrichtungen sowie Wettbewerbe im Breiten- und Freizeitsport. Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet: „Seit den ersten Öffnungen am 20. April ist die Zahl der täglichen Neuinfektionen in Nordrhein-Westfalen um mehr als 75 Prozent zurückgegangen. Lag sie im April im Wochendurchschnitt noch bei deutlich mehr als 500, liegt sie – Stand heute – landesweit bei 102. Den Menschen in unserem Land gebührt ein großer Dank. Das verantwortliche, rücksichtsvolle Verhalten der übergroßen Mehrheit beim Umgang mit der Covid-19-Pandemie erlaubt es uns, weitere Schritte unseres Nordrhein-Westfalen-Plans umzusetzen. Wir können unseren umsichtigen Kurs stufenweiser Öffnungen fortsetzen und damit den nächsten Schritt in eine verantwortungsvolle Normalität gehen. Wir setzen dabei weiter auf die Vernunft und die Eigenverantwortung der Menschen in unserem Land. Unverändert gilt es, wo immer möglich Abstand zu halten und verantwortungsvoll sich selbst und anderen gegenüber zu handeln.“ Der Nordrhein-Westfalen-Plan sieht für einzelne Bereiche unterschiedliche Stufen mit Zieldaten vor, die abhängig von der weiteren Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens umgesetzt werden sollen. Dieses Vorgehen bietet den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern in Nordrhein-Westfalen gleichzeitig Gesundheitsschutz sowie Planbarkeit und Verlässlichkeit für das wirtschaftliche und öffentliche Leben. Öffnungen finden unter stetiger Evaluierung und ausdrücklichem Vorbehalt der Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens statt. Bei den genannten Daten handelt es sich ebenfalls ausdrücklich um Zieldaten, bei denen auch von Abweichungen auszugehen ist. Die entsprechende rechtliche Verordnung wurde am Mittwoch, 27. Mai 2020 verkündet und tritt am 30. Mai 2020 in Kraft. Sie ist hier abrufbar. Die neuen Regelungen im Einzelnen Folgende Erleichterungen sieht die neue Corona-Schutzverordnung der Landesregierung für Nordrhein-Westfalen ab dem 30. Mai 2020 vor: Kontaktbeschränkungen und Verhaltensregeln Die bestehenden Kontaktbeschränkungen werden entsprechend dem Beschluss zwischen Bund und Ländern vom 26. Mai 2020 so weiterentwickelt, dass sich neben den bisher möglichen Konstellationen (Familie oder zwei Hausstände) eine Gruppe von bis zu zehn Personen im öffentlichen Raum treffen darf. Dies gilt unter der Voraussetzung, dass eine Rückverfolgbarkeit der am Treffen beteiligten Personen sichergestellt ist. Im Übrigen gilt die allgemeine Abstandsregel von 1,5 Metern fort, auch die Pflicht zum Tragen einer Mund-Nase-Bedeckung in bestimmten Bereichen. Kultureinrichtungen Kinos, Theater, Opern und Konzerthäuser können wieder für Besucher öffnen, wenn sie den Hygiene- und Infektionsschutz sicherstellen. Dies gilt auch für Veranstaltungsbereiche im Freien. Ein besonderes Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzept ist notwendig, wenn mehr als ein Viertel der regulären Zuschauerkapazität oder mehr als 100 Personen zuschauen sollen. Sport Personengruppen, die sich im Rahmen der Kontaktbeschränkungen treffen dürfen, wird auch der nicht-kontaktfreie Sport im Freien wieder gestattet. In diesem Rahmen sind Wettbewerbe im Breiten- und Freizeitsport im Freien unter Einhaltung eines Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzkonzepts wieder zulässig – auch die Nutzung von Umkleide- und Sanitäranlagen unter Auflagen. Im Übrigen bleibt der Sport-, Trainings- und Wettkampfbetrieb mit unvermeidbarem Körperkontakt weiterhin untersagt. Bahnen-Schwimmbecken, auch in Hallenbädern, können ihren Betrieb wiederaufnehmen. Ferienangebote Busreisen sind unter den Bedingungen des Infektionsschutzes wieder möglich. Schüler können ihre Sommerferien wieder mit Tagesausflügen, Ferienfreizeiten, Stadtranderholung und Ferienreisen unter Einhaltung der Hygiene- und Schutzvorschriften verbringen.

Ab dem 28. Mai 2020 erfolgt wie geplant die Öffnung der Kindertageseinrichtungen für alle Vorschulkinder. Am 8. Juni geht Nordrhein-Westfalen den nächsten Schritt seines Öffnungsplans und wechselt von der erweiterten Notbetreuung in den eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb. Alle Kinder können dann in reduziertem Umfang wieder ihre Kindertageseinrichtung oder Kindertagespflege besuchen. &nbsp; Familienminister Joachim Stamp: „Ich weiß, dass viele Familien in den letzten Wochen an die Grenze ihrer Belastbarkeit gekommen sind und vielen Kindern ohne frühkindliche Bildung täglich Chancen genommen werden. Es war mein fester Vorsatz, allen Kindern schnellstmöglich wieder ein Betreuungsangebot zu ermöglichen, sofern das verantwortbar ist. Daher bin ich sehr froh, dass wir angesichts des rückläufigen Infektionsgeschehens den nächsten Schritt unseres Öffnungsplans von der erweiterten Notbetreuung zu einem eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb gehen können.“ &nbsp; Für den Fall sinkender Infektionszahlen hat das nordrhein-westfälische Familienministerium frühzeitig konzeptionelle Vorschläge unter interdisziplinärer wissenschaftlicher Begleitung aus Kindheitspädagogik und Hygiene erarbeitet, wie Kita und Kindertagespflege in Zeiten von Corona einen Betrieb mit steigender Anzahl von Kindern ermöglichen können. Der eingeschränkte Regelbetrieb erfolgt im Rahmen des Infektionsschutzes. Zudem gibt das Land den Trägern Zeit, um die notwendige Umstellung sorgfältig vorbereiten zu können. Der eingeschränkte Regelbetrieb ab dem 8. Juni ist wie alle Schritte des Öffnungskonzepts eng mit den Kommunen und allen anderen Trägern abgestimmt. next prev 1 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Öffnung der Kindertagesbetreuung im eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb Presse-Briefing next prev 2 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Öffnung der Kindertagesbetreuung im eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb Presse-Briefing next prev 3 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Öffnung der Kindertagesbetreuung im eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb Presse-Briefing next prev 4 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Öffnung der Kindertagesbetreuung im eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb Presse-Briefing next prev 5 von 5 Foto: Land NRW Galerie Öffnung der Kindertagesbetreuung im eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb Presse-Briefing Zum Download öffnen Sie die Galerie bitte in der Mediathek. &nbsp; Eingeschränkter Regelbetrieb der Kindertagesbetreuung ab 8. Juni: Das Betretungsverbot für Kitas und Kindertagespflege wird aufgehoben; die bisherige Notbetreuung wird aufgelöst; alle Kinder dürfen wieder zu einem reduzierten Betreuungsumfang von 35, 25 und 15 Stunden pro Woche statt 45, 35, 25 in die Kita kommen; Kitas, die sich aufgrund räumlicher und personeller Kapazitäten in der Lage sehen, ein höheres Stundenangebot zu realisieren, können dies in Absprache mit den zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörden ermöglichen; Kitas, die aufgrund der Personalsituation außer Stande sind, dieses Angebot zu erbringen, können in Absprache mit dem örtlichen Jugendamt auch nach unten abweichen; dies sollte nur in Ausnahmefällen geschehen; Fälle des Kinderschutzes und besondere Härtefälle sind beim Betreuungsumfang zu berücksichtigen.&nbsp; Der eingeschränkte Regelbetrieb ab dem 8. Juni gilt auch für Kinder, deren Eltern in der bisherigen Notbetreuung im Einzelfall eine umfangreichere Betreuung in Anspruch nehmen konnten. Familienminister Stamp: „Ich appelliere an die Solidarität aller Eltern. Der Übergang in diese neue Phase des eingeschränkten Regelbetriebs wird eine große Herausforderung. Nicht alles wird reibungslos verlaufen. Die Bereitschaft zu Zugeständnissen ist von allen Seiten notwendig.“ &nbsp; Die Öffnung der Kindertagesbetreuung im eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb erfolgt mit quantitativen wie qualitativen Beschränkungen. Standards des Kinderbildungsgesetzes können noch nicht wieder erreicht und der Fachkraftschlüssel noch nicht erfüllt werden. Das nordrhein-westfälische Familienministerium hat aber klare Standards für den eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb definiert: Es gibt nur feste Gruppen, keine offenen Konzepte; in jeder Gruppe wird mindestens eine Fachkraft eingesetzt; die Gruppen sind weiterhin räumlich voneinander getrennt; alle Kontakte müssen nachvollziehbar sein, die Hygienekonzepte eingehalten werden.&nbsp; Auch für die Kindertagespflege fällt das Betretungsverbot zum 8. Juni. Grundsätzlich können alle Kinder wieder zu ihren Tagespflegepersonen. Da aber in diesem Bereich nicht alle Kräfte zur Verfügung stehen, kann es zu reduzierten Betreuungsumfängen kommen. &nbsp; Das Familienministerium begleitet den Schritt von der erweiterten Notbetreuung zum eingeschränkten Regelbetrieb mit einem wissenschaftlichen Monitoring in einer Modellkommune. Dabei werden regelmäßig wöchentlich mehrere tausend Kinder und Fachkräfte in Kindertageseinrichtungen getestet, das Infektionsgeschehen genau beobachtet und ausgewertet. In einem weiteren wissenschaftlichen Monitoring werden die Schutzmaßnahmen arbeitsmedizinisch untersucht und dabei geprüft, in wieweit die Arbeitsschutz- und Hygienemaßnahmen zum Schutz der Beschäftigten und Kinder greifen. &nbsp; Familienminister Stamp: „Die Belange der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter haben wir fest im Blick. Das ist mir sehr wichtig. Darum haben wir nicht nur einen ausreichenden zeitlichen Vorlauf zur Vorbereitung gewählt, sondern werden die Arbeit der Kitas vor Ort konkret unterstützen.“ &nbsp; Dazu zählt: Lieferung von 2 Millionen FFP-2 Masken und 3 Millionen OP-Masken an die Jugendämter als Starthilfe im Rahmen der Arbeitsschutzmaßnahmen, finanzieller Zuschuss an die Träger zum Ausgleich der außergewöhnlichen zusätzlichen Belastungen, die durch die Arbeitsschutzmaßnahmen entstehen, telefonische Beratungsstelle für alle Kita-Leitungen, um Fragen zu Hygiene und Arbeitsschutz fachkompetent zu beantworten. Diese Beratung wird bereits ab dem 26. Mai 2020 zur Verfügung stehen. Personalgewinnungsprogramm, mit dem Hilfskräfte für die Kitas gewonnen werden sollen, die die pädagogischen Fachkräfte vor Ort entlasten (z.B. Händewaschen, Schuhe an- und ausziehen usw.).&nbsp; Familienminister Stamp: „Der Schritt, den wir jetzt gehen, ist eine große Herausforderung für alle Beteiligten. Wir gehen ihn planvoll, verantwortungsbewusst und unter wissenschaftlicher Begleitung.“ Die Phase des eingeschränkten Regelbetriebs ist zunächst bis zum 31. August 2020 vorgesehen. Auf Basis der wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse wird Mitte August über die nächsten Schritte entschieden. &nbsp; Folgen Sie uns im Netz: Twitter: @chancennrw Facebook: Chancen NRW Instagram: chancen_nrw YouTube: Chancen NRW &nbsp;","2020-05-20","2021-01-21 14:28:36","2021-01-21 14:28:36","2021-01-21 14:28:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\IJUZJ5TB\oeffnung-der-kindertagesbetreuung-im-eingeschraenkten-regelbetrieb.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die corona-bedingten Flächenbeschränkungen beim Handel entfallen, Fachmessen sollen ab Ende Mai wieder veranstaltet werden können. Alle Öffnungen stehen unter der Voraussetzung, dass sich die Infektionslage nicht verschlechtert. Das teilte Wirtschaftsminister Prof. Dr. Andreas Pinkwart mit. &nbsp; Pinkwart: „Die Wiederbelebung der Wirtschaft ist dringend nötig. Denn wir befinden uns in der größten Krise seit Ende des 2. Weltkriegs. Viele Händler haben massive Einbußen erlitten. Ich freue mich daher sehr, dass alle Geschäfte größenunabhängig vom 11. Mai an wieder öffnen dürfen. Das gibt neue Kaufimpulse und die Ertragslage der Betriebe kann sich wieder verbessern. Zudem nutzen wir die Spielräume, die wir uns erarbeitet haben, um die am härtesten getroffenen Branchen Gastronomie und Tourismus verantwortlich und behutsam zu öffnen. Schritt für Schritt müssen Gastronomen und Hoteliers die Umsätze erreichen, die sie vor der Krise erzielen konnten – nur so können sie ihren 150.000 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern eine Perspektive geben. Schließlich dürfen Fachmessen und Fachkongresse, wenn die Infektionslage sich nicht verschlechtert, demnächst unter strengen Auflagen wieder stattfinden – damit ist das Messeland Nordrhein-Westfalen Vorreiter in Deutschland. Bei jedem dieser Schritte gilt: Wir halten die Balance zwischen Gesundheitsschutz und der wirtschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Öffnung, um das Erreichte nicht zu gefährden.“ &nbsp; Beim Neustart der Gastronomie am&nbsp;11. Mai&nbsp;gelten folgende Besonderheiten: An einem Tisch können Personen aus zwei Haushalten sitzen. Eine Begrenzung der Personenzahl ist nicht vorgesehen. Tische müssen 1,5 Meter auseinander stehen. Platzanweisungen und namentliche Registrierungen ermöglichen die Nachverfolgung. Um Besucherströme zu entzerren, verzichtet Nordrhein-Westfalen auf eine corona-bedingte Begrenzung der Öffnungszeiten und der Verweildauer der Gäste in den Restaurants. Buffet-Lösungen sind nicht zulässig. &nbsp; Weitere Öffnungen am 11. Mai: Ferienwohnungen und –häuser/Camping Freizeitparks/Ausflugsschiffe &nbsp; Öffnung 18.

Dieser sieht vor, die Anti-Corona-Maßnahmen im Kulturbereich in den kommenden Wochen und Monaten schrittweise zu reduzieren – abhängig von der weiteren Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens. &nbsp; „Die zurückliegenden Wochen haben auf schmerzliche Weise deutlich gemacht, wie sehr das persönliche kulturelle Erleben in unserem Alltag fehlt. Umso mehr freut es mich, dass die aktuelle Entwicklung jetzt eine behutsame Öffnung des kulturellen Lebens möglich macht. Bei aller Freude dürfen wir jedoch nicht vergessen, dass der Schutz der Künstlerinnen und Künstler, der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter der Einrichtungen sowie der Besucherinnen und Besucher weiterhin an erster Stelle stehen müssen. Ich bin aber absolut überzeugt, dass die Kultur in Nordrhein-Westfalen auch diese Herausforderung erfolgreich meistern wird“, sagt Kulturministerin Isabel Pfeiffer-Poensgen. &nbsp; Erste Lockerungen sind bereits umgesetzt worden: Museen, Ausstellungen und Musikschulen dürfen unter strikter Einhaltung der Abstands- und Hygieneregelungen und teilweise weiteren Auflagen wieder öffnen, ebenso Bibliotheken und Archive. &nbsp; Ab Montag, 11. Mai, sollen in einer nächsten Stufe auch kleinere Konzerte und andere öffentliche Aufführungen unter freiem Himmel ermöglicht werden. Bei Einhaltung strenger Regelungen, Mund-Nase-Bedeckung sowie einem mit der örtlichen Behörde abgestimmten Konzept sind solche Aufführungen grundsätzlich auch in Gebäuden zulässig. In Musikschulen sind ab 11. Mai neben Einzelunterricht auch Ensembles mit maximal sechs Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmern möglich. Ebenfalls wird der Probenbetrieb unter Schutzauflagen ermöglicht, für Chöre und Orchester gelten erweiterte Abstandsregeln. &nbsp; Eine weitere Stufe zur verantwortungsvollen Wiederaufnahme des kulturellen Lebens in Nordrhein-Westfalen wird am 30. Mai erfolgen: Ab diesem Datum soll Kinos sowie kleineren Theatern, Opern und Konzerthäusern eine Wiedereröffnung ermöglicht werden, sofern der Mindestabstand von 1,5 Metern zwischen Besuchern gewährleistet werden kann und die Einrichtungen ein Zutrittskonzept für den Einlass sowie das Verlassen der Häuser vorlegen können. Das von den Häusern vorzulegende Zutrittskonzept sieht u.a. vor, dass zwischen haushaltsfremden Besuchern jeweils zwei Sitzplätze freizuhalten sind und Vorkehrungen zum Schutz der im Bühnenbereich tätigen Personen getroffen werden. Zudem soll verstärkt Ordnungspersonal eingesetzt werden, um Menschenansammlungen im Warte- und Pausenbereich zu verhindern. &nbsp; Bei den großen Theatern, Opern und Konzerthäusern, bei denen die Anpassung an die Bedingungen der Pandemie eine etwas längere Vorbereitungszeit erfordert, ist wie bei Großveranstaltungen eine Wiederaufnahme des regulären Aufführungsbetriebs zum Start der nächsten Spielzeit ab dem 1. September realistisch. &nbsp; „Gerade die Theater haben in den vergangenen Wochen eine enorme Flexibilität und Kreativität gezeigt, wie sie bei einem künftigen Spielbetrieb den aktuellen Gegebenheiten Rechnung tragen wollen – etwa mit neuen, auf die Corona-Bedingungen angepassten Spielplänen oder kreativen Konzepten zur Einhaltung der Abstandsregeln. Daher freut es mich besonders, dass sie in der kommenden Woche wieder mit den Proben beginnen können und hoffentlich schon bald wieder erste Stücke für ihre Zuschauer auf die Bühne bringen können“, sagt Ministerin Pfeiffer-Poensgen. „Bei den großen Häusern mit ihren zahlreichen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern und dem aufwändigen Probenbetrieb ist diese Umstellung naturgemäß nicht so schnell umsetzbar, weshalb sie ihren Spielbetrieb mit Beginn der kommenden Spielzeit aufnehmen werden. Damit haben auch sie Planungssicherheit für die nächste Zeit und können mit der gebotenen Sorgfalt die Spielpläne, Inszenierungen sowie das Besucher- und Hygienemanagement auf die aktuellen Vorgaben anpassen“, so die Ministerin. &nbsp;","2020-05-07","2021-01-21 14:15:12","2021-01-21 14:15:12","2021-01-21 14:15:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\XUPB3P4R\landesregierung-beschliesst-stufenplan-zur-wiederaufnahme-des-kulturbetriebs.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"UPXII823","webpage","2020","","Nordrhein-Westfalen-Plan tritt in Kraft | Das Landesportal Wir in NRW","","","","","/de/pressemitteilung/nordrhein-westfalen-plan-tritt-kraft-stufenweise-oeffnung-der-anti-corona","Ab Montag (11. Mai 2020) gelten in Nordrhein-Westfalen im Zuge des maßvoll abgestimmten Nordrhein-Westfalen-Plans der Landesregierung weitere Öffnungen der Anti-Corona-Maßnahmen. Dazu gehören unter anderem die Öffnung der Kontaktbeschränkung auf Personen zweier Haushalte, die Öffnung von Geschäften unabhängig von ihrer Größe, der Speise-Gastronomie drinnen und draußen sowie von Sporthallen und Fitnessstudios unter strengen Auflagen. Zudem ist für weitere Schülerinnen und Schüler der Unterricht in den Schulen wieder möglich. Die Kindertagesbetreuung wird ab 14. Mai 2020 stufenweise ausgeweitet. Weitere Erleichterungen folgen in weiteren Stufen, so etwa die Besuchsregelungen in Krankenhäusern, Vorsorge- und Rehabilitationseinrichtungen unter strengen Auflagen zum 20. Mai 2020 oder die Öffnung von Hotels und Pensionen ab 18. Mai 2020. &nbsp; Mit dem Nordrhein-Westfalen-Plan sollen in Nordrhein-Westfalen in den kommenden Tagen und Wochen die Anti-Corona-Maßnahmen geöffnet werden. Das Konzept sieht für die einzelnen Bereiche unterschiedliche Stufen mit Zieldaten vor, die abhängig von der weiteren Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens umgesetzt werden sollen. Dieses Vorgehen bietet den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern in Nordrhein-Westfalen gleichzeitig Gesundheitsschutz sowie Planbarkeit und Verlässlichkeit für das wirtschaftliche und öffentliche Leben. Die Landesregierung setzt dabei auf die Eigenverantwortung der Menschen. Öffnungen finden unter stetiger Evaluierung und ausdrücklichem Vorbehalt der Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens statt. Bei den genannten Daten handelt es sich ebenfalls ausdrücklich um Zieldaten, bei denen auch von Abweichungen auszugehen ist. &nbsp; Die entsprechenden rechtlichen Verordnungen (Neufassung der Coronaschutzverordnung, Aktualisierung der Coronabetreuungsverordnung und der Coronaeinreiseverordnung) wurden am Samstag (9. Mai 2020) rechtskräftig verkündet und veröffentlicht. Diese sind hier abrufbar: Neufassung der Coronaschutzverordnung Aktualisierung der Coronabetreuungsverordnung Coronaeinreiseverordnung Die Regelungen im Einzelnen Folgendes stufenweises Vorgehen sieht der Nordrhein-Westfalen-Plan der Landesregierung vor, der in seiner Umsetzung jeweils unter dem Vorbehalt der Entwicklung des Infektionsgeschehens steht: &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Kontaktverbot und Verhaltensregeln Ab dem&nbsp;11. Mai&nbsp;werden die bestehenden Kontaktbeschränkungen so weiterentwickelt, dass es auch möglich ist, dass sich die Angehörigen zweier Haushalte im öffentlichen Raum treffen. Die allgemeine Abstandsregelung von 1,5 Metern gilt fort, auch die Pflicht zum Tragen einer Mund-Nase-Bedeckung in bestimmten Bereichen. &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Kinderbetreuung &nbsp; Ab Donnerstag,&nbsp;14. Mai, wird die Kindertagesbetreuung schrittweise geöffnet, zunächst für Vorschulkinder mit einer Anspruchsberechtigung nach dem Bildungs- und Teilhabegesetz sowie für Kinder mit Behinderungen und Kinder, die von einer wesentlichen Behinderung bedroht sind. Zudem werden die Kindertagespflegestellenangebote für Kinder, die ihr zweites Lebensjahr vollendet haben, geöffnet sowie für Brückenprojekte. Auch von Eltern organisierte private Betreuung ist zulässig, sofern die Kinder in gleichen Gruppen bleiben. &nbsp; In einem weiteren Schritt sollen ab&nbsp;28. Mai&nbsp;wieder alle übrigen Vorschulkinder in die Kindertagesbetreuung aufgenommen werden. Weitere Öffnungen sind im Juni vorgesehen. &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;Schulen &nbsp; Ab Montag, 11. Mai 2020,&nbsp;kehren an Gymnasien und Gesamtschulen vorrangig die Schülerinnen und Schüler zurück, die im nächsten Schuljahr 2020/21 ihr Abitur ablegen. Sollten darüber hinaus räumliche und personelle Kapazitäten zur Verfügung stehen, ist die Beschulung weiterer Lerngruppen beziehungsweise Klassen von der Jahrgangsstufe 5 bis hin zu den Schülerinnen und Schülern der Einführungsphase tageweise in einem rollierenden System möglich. An den Schulformen der Sekundarstufe I (Haupt-, Real-, Sekundar-, PRIMUS- und Gemeinschaftsschulen) kehren zudem ein bis zwei Jahrgänge der Klassenstufen 5 bis 9 in einem tageweise rollierenden System zurück. Bis zum Abschluss der dezentralen Prüfungen, die in diesem Jahr die Zentralen Abschlussprüfungen in Klasse 10 ersetzen, erhält die Jahrgangsstufe 10 weiterhin vorrangig Unterricht. Danach wird dieser Jahrgang mit in das rollierende System einbezogen. &nbsp; Ebenfalls&nbsp;ab Montag, 11. Mai,&nbsp;werden an den Grundschulen die Jahrgangsstufen 1 bis 4 in einem regelhaften Wechsel mit einem Jahrgang pro Tag wieder unterrichtet. Offener Ganztag und weitere Betreuungsangebote werden parallel zum Unterricht und zur Notbetreuung im Rahmen der vorhandenen räumlichen und personellen Ressourcen wiederaufgenommen. &nbsp; Wie an den Grundschulen werden&nbsp;ab dem 11. Mai&nbsp;auch die Schülerinnen und Schüler der Jahrgänge 1 bis 4 an Förderschulen in regelhaftem Wechsel mit einem Jahrgang pro Tag unterrichtet (mit Ausnahme der Förderschwerpunkte Geistige Entwicklung sowie Körperliche und motorische Entwicklung). Zudem sollen nach Möglichkeit Schülerinnen und Schüler aus ein bis zwei Jahrgängen der Klassenstufen 5 bis 9 im rollierenden System an die Schulen zurückkehren. &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;Stationäre Gesundheits- und Pflegeeinrichtungen &nbsp; Mit Blick auf den&nbsp;Muttertag&nbsp;sind seit&nbsp;Samstag, 9. Mai, Besuche in Senioren- und Pflegeheimen unter strengen Hygienevorgaben wieder möglich. Besucherinnen und Besuchern wird empfohlen, vorher bei den Einrichtungen anzurufen, damit diese die Besuche mit Blick auf Hygiene und Infektionsschutz besser planen können. Ab dem&nbsp;20. Mai&nbsp;&nbsp;gilt die Öffnung auch in Krankenhäusern sowie Vorsorge- und Rehabilitationseinrichtungen (maximal ein Besuch pro Tag und Patient von maximal zwei Personen). Die Einrichtungen können Besuchszeiträume festlegen. Besuchsverbote für die gesamte Einrichtung oder einzelne Abteilungen können von den Einrichtungen erlassen werden, wenn das aktuelle Infektionsgeschehen dies erfordert. Einzelne Krankenhäuser können Besuche bereits ab&nbsp;dem 11. Mai&nbsp;zulassen. &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;Sport und Freizeit &nbsp; Für den Sport- und Freizeitbereich gelten folgende Stufen: &nbsp; Bereits seit Donnerstag (7. Mai )&nbsp;ist der Sport- und Trainingsbetrieb im kontaktlosen Breiten- und Freizeitsport wieder erlaubt – sofern der Sport auf öffentlichen oder privaten Freiluftsportanlagen oder im öffentlichen Raum stattfindet. Ein Abstand zwischen Personen von 1,5 Metern und die Einhaltung strikter Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzmaßnahmen müssen gewährleitstet sein. Dusch-, Wasch-, Umkleide-, Gesellschafts- und sonstige Gemeinschaftsräume dürfen bis auf weiteres nicht genutzt werden. Zudem sind Zuschauerbesuche vorerst untersagt. Bei Kindern bis 14 Jahren ist jedoch das Betreten der Sportanlage durch jeweils eine erwachsene Begleitperson zulässig. &nbsp; Der Reitsport ist auch in geschlossenen Reitsportanlagen und Hallen bereits zulässig. &nbsp; Ab 11. Mai&nbsp;ist die Öffnung von Fitnessstudios und Tanzschulen sowie von Sporthallen/Kursräumen der Sportvereine für den kontaktlosen Freizeit- und Breitensport unter strengen Abstands- und Hygieneauflagen wieder möglich. &nbsp; Freibäder dürfen&nbsp;ab 20. Mai&nbsp;unter strengen Auflagen von Abstand und Hygiene öffnen – ausgenommen sind reine Spaßbäder. &nbsp; Ab 30. Mai&nbsp;soll die Ausübung von Sportarten auch mit unvermeidbarem Körperkontakt und in geschlossenen Räumen wieder zulässig sein, ebenso der Betrieb in Hallenbädern. Sportliche Wettbewerbe im Kinder-, Jugend- und Amateurbereich sollen dann ebenfalls zulässig sein – die Nutzung von Umkleide- und Sanitäranlagen soll dann unter Auflagen gestattet sein. &nbsp; 6.&nbsp;Gastronomie, Hotels, Tourismus Für die Gastronomie, Hotellerie und den Tourismus wird eine stufenweise Öffnung angestrebt. Ab dem&nbsp;11. Mai&nbsp;sind wieder möglich: Betrieb von Restaurants, Gaststätten, Kneipen, Imbissen, (Eis-) Cafes, öffentlich zugänglichen Mensen und Kantinen sowie anderen Einrichtungen der Speisegastronomie, sofern im Innen- und – wenn vorhanden – Außenbereich die Einhaltung des Abstandsgebots und der vom Gesundheitsministerium für die Gastronomie festgelegten&nbsp;Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzstandards&nbsp;gewährleistet ist. Am selben Tisch dürfen nur Personen sitzen, die dem Kontaktverbot nicht unterfallen (zum Beispiel Familien, zwei häusliche Gemeinschaften). Buffet-Angebote mit offenen Lebensmitteln bleiben nicht zulässig. Touristische Nutzung und Aufenthalt in Ferienwohnungen, Ferienhäusern und auf Campingplätzen (unter Wahrung der Kontaktbeschränkungen). Öffnung von Freizeitparks (mit genehmigtem Hygienekonzept), Ausflugsschiffen, Fahrrad- und Bootsverleihen. &nbsp; Ab 18. Mai&nbsp;dürfen Hotels, Pensionen, Jugendherbergen und ähnliche Beherbungsbetriebe auch für Touristen mit Wohnsitz in Deutschland wieder öffnen. Dafür gelten strenge Auflagen analog zur Gastronomie mit vom Gesundheitsministerium für die Gastronomie festgelegten Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzstandards sowie der Gewährleistung von Abstandsregelungen und Kontaktbeschränkungen. &nbsp; Mit Zieldatum ab Pfingsten (30. Mai) soll auch die Öffnung von Thermen und Schwimmbädern, Spaßbädern und Wellness-Einrichtungen unter passgenauen Infektionsschutzkonzepten wieder zulässig sein. &nbsp; Ausgenommen von den Öffnungen bleiben bis auf weiteres Bars, Clubs, Diskotheken und Bordellbetriebe. 7.&nbsp;Handel und Dienstleistungen &nbsp; Geschäfte dürfen unabhängig von ihrer Größe unter Auflagen zu Abstands- und Hygieneregeln (1 Person pro 10 qm Verkaufsfläche)&nbsp;ab&nbsp;11. Mai&nbsp;wieder öffnen. Das gilt unter vom Gesundheitsministerium festgelegten strengen Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzstandards auch für Kosmetik, Nagelstudios, Maniküre und Massage. Tätowieren bleibt zunächst noch untersagt. &nbsp; 8.&nbsp;Großveranstaltungen und Versammlungen &nbsp; Großveranstaltungen (etwa Volksfeste, Jahrmärkte, Stadt-, Dorf- und Straßenfeste, Schützenfeste, Weinfeste und ähnliche Festveranstaltungen) bleiben&nbsp;bis&nbsp;31. August&nbsp;untersagt. Für Versammlungen gelten die bestehenden Abstandsregelungen. Mit Zieldatum ab&nbsp;30. Mai&nbsp;sollen Fachmessen und Fachkongresse mit Schutzkonzepten und unter Beschränkung der Besucher- und Teilnehmerzahlen wieder stattfinden können. &nbsp; 9.&nbsp;Kulturangebote &nbsp; Ab 11. Mai&nbsp;sind kleinere Konzerte und andere öffentliche Aufführungen unter freiem Himmel zulässig – oder auf der Grundlage eines strengen Hygienekonzepts nach behördlicher Genehmigung auch in Gebäuden. In Musikschulen sind auch Ensembles mit maximal sechs Teilnehmern möglich. Der Probenbetrieb in Kultureinrichtungen ist unter Schutzauflagen zulässig, ausgenommen sind wegen der besonderen Infektionsgefahren aber noch Chöre und Orchester mit Blasinstrumenten. &nbsp; Ab dem&nbsp;30. Mai&nbsp;soll die Öffnung von Kinos, Theatern, Opern- und Konzerthäusern wieder zulässig sein, sofern der Mindestabstand von 1,5 Metern zwischen Besuchern gewährleistet ist und es ein Zutrittskonzept gibt. Durch den verstärkten Einsatz von Ordnern sind Ansammlungen im Warte- und Pausenbereich zu verhindern. &nbsp; Bei den großen Theatern, Opern und Konzerthäusern, bei denen die Anpassung an die Bedingungen der Pandemie eine etwas längere Vorbereitungszeit erfordert, ist wie bei Großveranstaltungen eine Wiederaufnahme des regulären Aufführungsbetriebs zum Start der nächsten Spielzeit ab dem&nbsp;1. September&nbsp;realistisch. &nbsp; 10.&nbsp;Hochschulen &nbsp; Für den Lehr- und Prüfungsbetrieb wird&nbsp;ab dem 11. Mai&nbsp;die Einschränkung der Zulässigkeit von Präsenzveranstaltungen „auf besondere Räumlichkeiten, Ausstattungen oder sonstige besondere Rahmenbedingungen“ aufgehoben. &nbsp; Der Lehr- und Prüfungsbetrieb an den Schulen des Gesundheitswesens und an den der Berufsausbildung im Öffentlichen Dienst dienenden Schulen, Instituten und ähnlichen Einrichtungen ist weiter unter Auflagen zulässig. Die Hochschulen führen den Vorlesungsbetrieb im Sommersemester prinizipiell digital durch. &nbsp; 11.&nbsp;Außerschulische Bildungseinrichtungen &nbsp; Ab 11. Mai&nbsp;sind Veranstaltungen in Volkshochschulen und sonstigen öffentlichen, kirchlichen und privaten außerschulischen Bildungseinrichtungen inklusive Prüfungswesen auch in großen Räumen unter strengen Abstands- und Hygieneauflagen und mit maximal 100 Teilnehmern zulässig. Sportliche Angebote der Kinder- und Jugendarbeit sind bereits seit dem 7. Mai kontaktfrei wieder möglich. &nbsp; Ab dem 30. Mai&nbsp;soll ein einschränkter Regelbetrieb der Jugendarbeit, Jugendkulturarbeit, Jugendsozialarbeit und erzieherischer Kinder- und Jugendschutz zulässig sein. Ferienmaßnahmen können vornehmlich ortsnah aufgenommen werden, ebenso Gruppenfahrten (etwa der Jugendverbände). &nbsp; 12.&nbsp;Gottesdienste &nbsp; Unter Berücksichtigung der Hygiene- und Schutzkonzepte der Kirchen und Religionsgemeinschaften finden Gottesdienste seit 1. Mai wieder statt.","2020-05-09","2021-01-21 11:32:59","2021-01-21 11:32:59","2021-01-21 11:32:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\X27EEJZ4\nordrhein-westfalen-plan-tritt-kraft-stufenweise-oeffnung-der-anti-corona.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dazu zählen etwa Museen und Galerien oder Zoologische Gärten und Garten- und Landschaftsparks. Spielplätze sollen in Abstimmung mit den Kommunalen Spitzenverbänden nach entsprechender Vorbereitung von den Kommunen ab Donnerstag (7. Mai) wieder geöffnet werden können, zeitgleich zur Wiederaufnahme des Unterrichts für die 4. Klassen in den Grundschulen. Nordrhein-Westfalen setzt damit die gemeinsamen Beschlüsse der Ministerpräsidentenkonferenz mit Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel um, festgeschrieben in der aktualisierten Coronaschutzverordnung des Landes. Die Änderungen treten – mit Ausnahme der Spielplätze – zum 4. Mai 2020 in Kraft und gelten vorerst bis zum 10. Mai 2020. &nbsp; Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet: „Nach den notwendigen Einschränkungen der vergangenen Wochen sind die Beschlüsse der Ministerpräsidentenkonferenz vom 30. April der nächste Schritt in eine verantwortungsvolle Normalität. Die guten Zahlen zur Entwicklung der Infektionen in Nordrhein-Westfalen machen Hoffnung, dass bald weitere Öffnungen möglich sein werden. Mit Schutz und Abstand so wenige Einschränkungen wie nötig und so viel Entfaltung wie möglich – daran arbeiten wir mit den Städten und Gemeinden im ganzen Land. Bei unserem heutigen gemeinsamen Austausch mit den kommunalen Spitzenverbänden haben wir uns eng zu der Umsetzung der gestrigen Beschlüsse und zum weiteren Vorgehen im Bereich Schule und Frühkindliche Bildung abgestimmt.” &nbsp; Neben Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet und Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann nahmen am 2. Kommunal-Videogipfel der stellvertretende Ministerpräsident und Familienminister Dr. Joachim Stamp, Schulministerin Yvonne Gebauer und Kommunalministerin Ina Scharrenbach teil. &nbsp; Familienminister Joachim Stamp: „Die Öffnung der Spielplatze ist ein kleiner, aber wichtiger Schritt für unsere Kinder und die Familien. Kinder brauchen die Möglichkeit zu toben und mit Gleichaltrigen spielen zu können. Deshalb freue ich mich, dass wir uns mit dieser Forderung bundesweit durchsetzen konnten.“ &nbsp; Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann appelliert: „Gerade für die Betreiber, die nach den ab Montag geltenden Neuregelungen ihren Betrieb wieder aufnehmen können, ist das sicherlich eine Erleichterung. Aber ich appelliere an die Bürgerinnen und Bürger: So schön ein Besuch im Tierpark oder im Museum auch ist, haben die Hygiene- und Infektionsschutzvorgaben nach wie vor oberste Priorität. Nur wenn wir hier alle an einem Strang ziehen, können wir langsam, Schritt für Schritt wieder ein möglichst normales Leben führen.“ &nbsp; Vor allem im Hinblick auf die Spielplätze verdeutlicht der Minister: „Ich finde es absolut wichtig, dass wir unseren Kindern das Spielen an der frischen Luft wieder ermöglichen. Eins ist dabei ganz wichtig: Dass die Eltern Verantwortung übernehmen und ihrerseits Abstand halten. Ich habe großes Vertrauen, dass alle wissen, worum es jetzt geht und das so umsetzen. Öffnung und verantwortliches Verhalten müssen Hand in Hand gehen.“ &nbsp; Spielplätze dürfen in Nordrhein-Westfalen ab Donnerstag wieder genutzt werden. Hier gelten für Begleitpersonen die bekannten Abstandsregeln von 1,5 Metern. Die neuen Regelungen Im Einzelnen ist vorgesehen, dass Museen, Kunstausstellungen, Galerien und ähnliche Einrichtungen sowie Tierparks und Zoologische Gärten ab Montag wieder öffnen dürfen. Das gilt auch für Garten- und Landschaftsparks wie etwa die Landesgartenschau in Kamp-Lintfort. Freizeitparks bleiben dagegen vorläufig weiter geschlossen. Voraussetzung für die Öffnungen sind geeignete Vorkehrungen zur Hygiene, zur Steuerung des Zutritts sowie zur Gewährleistung eines Mindestabstands von 1,5 Metern zwischen Personen. In Museen, Kunstausstellungen sowie Galerien und ähnlichen Einrichtungen sowie in geschlossenen Räumlichkeiten der Tierparks, Zoologischen und Botanischen Gärten und der Landesgartenschau ist eine Mund-Nase-Bedeckung zu tragen. Ausgenommen davon sind Kinder bis zum Schuleintritt sowie Personen, die aus medizinischen Gründen keine Mund-Nase-Bedeckung tragen können. Außerdem ist die Anzahl von gleichzeitig anwesenden Besuchern auf eine Person pro zehn Quadratmeter der Besucherflächen beschränkt. &nbsp; Friseure sowie die medizinische und kosmetische Fußpflege können ebenfalls ab Montag unter Hygieneauflagen wieder tätig werden. &nbsp; Folgende Bildungsangebote dürfen stattfinden, sofern Hygienemaßnahmen und ein Mindestabstand von 1,5 Metern zwischen Personen gewährleistet sind: Volkshochschulen Musikschulen Sonstige öffentliche, behördliche und private außerschulische Bildungseinrichtungen Berufsaus-, -fort und -weiterbildungen sowie das zugehörige Prüfungswesen Veranstaltungen und Versammlungen bleiben bis auf weiteres mit wenigen Ausnahmen untersagt. Zulässig sind nur Versammlungen, die der öffentlichen Sicherheit und Ordnung dienen sowie Versammlungen gesetzlich vorgesehener Gremien von beispielweise Institutionen oder Vereinen. Großveranstaltungen bleiben bis zum 31. August komplett untersagt. Darunter fallen beispielsweise Volksfeste, Spezialmärkte und Jahrmärkte sowie Kirmesveranstaltungen, (Musik)Festivals sowie Schützen- oder Weinfeste. &nbsp; Die aktualisierte Coronaschutzverordnung ist&nbsp;hier&nbsp;abrufbar:&nbsp;https://www.land.nrw/sites/default/files/asset/document/2020-05-01_fassung_coronaschvo_ab_04.05.2020.pdf","2020-05-01","2021-01-21 11:21:59","2021-01-21 11:21:59","2021-01-21 11:21:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\4HM3RDWB\mit-abstand-und-schutz-betrieb-bestimmter-kultur-und-freizeiteinrichtungen-ab.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Damit kann auch die Landesgartenschau in Kamp-Lintfort unter Auflagen ihre Pforten für Besucherinnen und Besucher öffnen. Hierauf hat sich die Landesregierung aufbauend auf den aktuellen Beschlüssen der Ministerpräsidentenkonferenz vom 30. April 2020 verständigt. Sofern Zoos und Gärten die erforderlichen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen getroffen haben, entscheiden und kommunizieren sie selbst, wann und wie sie öffnen. Die konkreten Auflagen sind in der ab dem 4. Mai 2020 gültigen Fassung der Coronaschutzverordnung (CoronaSchVO) geregelt.&nbsp; &nbsp; Umwelt- und Landwirtschaftsministerin Heinen-Esser kommentiert die Entscheidung wie folgt: „Ich freue mich, dass in diesen schwierigen Zeiten gerade in urbanen Räumen wieder wichtige naturnahe Ruhe- und Erholungsinseln geschaffen werden. Ich appelliere an alle Besucherinnen und Besucher, diese Angebote besonnen zu genießen und sich ganz konsequent an die Hygiene-Vorgaben zu halten. Bitte unterstützen Sie die Betreiber und setzen dieses wiedergewonnene Stück Freiheit nicht durch Missachtung der Hygiene- und Abstandsregeln aufs Spiel.“ &nbsp; Erst in der vergangenen Woche hatte die Landesregierung für Zoos und Tierparks eine finanzielle Unterstützung in Höhe von rund 11,8 Millionen Euro verabschiedet. In Kamp-Lintfort konnten sich Bürgerinnen und Bürger an ausgewählten Tagen im April auf einem festgelegten Rundgang bereits einen ersten Eindruck von der Landesgartenschau verschaffen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; „Zoos, Gärten und Parks erfüllen wichtige Aufgaben im Naturschutz und bringen gerade den Menschen in den Ballungsräumen Tiere und Natur nahe. Sie bewegen Menschen und Regionen. Auch Gartenschauen leisten einen bedeutenden Beitrag zur Biodiversität und zum Ausbau der grünen Infrastruktur.

Dieser Selbstverpflichtung sind die Kirchen und Religionsgemeinschaften in beeindruckender Weise nachgekommen. &nbsp; Im Nachgang zu Gesprächen des Ministerpräsidenten Armin Laschet und des stellvertretenden Ministerpräsidenten Dr. Joachim Stamp mit den Kirchen sowie Religionsgemeinschaften über die Wiederaufnahme der öffentlichen Durchführung von Gottesdiensten in der vergangenen Woche hat die Landesregierung in diesen Tagen Konzepte der Religionsgemeinschaften erhalten, wie während der Corona-Pandemie Gottesdienste unter Beachtung des Infektionsschutzes gestaltet werden können. &nbsp; Auf der Grundlage der gleichermaßen umfassenden und präzisen vorgelegten Konzepte und Maßnahmenkataloge sieht die Landesregierung die Möglichkeit, dass zeitnah Gottesdienste wieder unter Beteiligung von Gläubigen gefeiert werden können. Die Kirchen und Religionsgemeinschaften haben erklärt, die Vorkehrungen zur Einhaltung des Abstands und zum Schutz bis zum 1. Mai 2020 vornehmen zu können. Gottesdienste und Versammlungen zur Religionsausübung in Nordrhein-Westfalen werden ab Mai wieder öffentlich stattfinden. &nbsp; Hierzu erklärt Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet: „Die Freiheit der Religionsausübung ist ein wichtiges Grundrecht unserer Verfassung. Wir sind dankbar für das hohe Maß an Verständnis und Verantwortung von Kirchen und Religionsgemeinschaften in Nordrhein-Westfalen in der Corona-Krise. Jüdische Gemeinden haben auf die gemeinsame Feier des Pessachfestes verzichtet und Christen auf die großen Gottesdienste an den Hochfesten von Gründonnerstag bis Ostern. Die Muslime ihrerseits haben erklärt, den Auftakt zum Ramadan ohne gemeinsames Freitagsgebet zu feiern und den Ramadan mit seinen allabendlichen Begegnungen zum Fastenbrechen anders zu gestalten als in allen Jahren zuvor. Wir bringen dieses konstruktive Miteinander von Staat und Religionsgemeinschaften ebenso wie die konkreten Schutzkonzepte auch in die bundesweite Verständigung zur Wiederaufnahme des religiösen Lebens in Deutschland ein.“ &nbsp; Der stellvertretende Ministerpräsident Dr. Joachim Stamp erklärt: „Die Religionsgemeinschaften und die Gläubigen haben mit ihrem selbst gewählten Verzicht auf gemeinsame Gottesdienste einen wichtigen Beitrag zur erfolgreichen Eindämmung der Pandemie geleistet. Mit den vorgelegten Konzepten für die weitere Eindämmung kommen sie ihrer Verantwortung für die Gesundheit der Gemeindemitglieder und Gottesdienstbesucher mit großer Sorgfalt nach. Die Religionsgemeinschaften in Nordrhein-Westfalen haben in der Krise Verantwortungsbewusstsein gezeigt. Sie haben selbst den Weg dafür bereitet, dass nun unter den Regeln von Abstand und Schutz wieder gemeinsam Gottesdienst gefeiert werden kann.“ &nbsp;","2020-04-23","2021-01-21 10:45:18","2021-01-21 10:45:26","2021-01-21 10:45:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","de","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\desvarsa\Zotero\storage\584VMEVT\wiederaufnahme-von-versammlungen-zur-religionsausuebung-nordrhein-westfalen-ab-dem.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

April 2020, weitere Maßnahmen zum Umgang mit der Coronavirus-Pandemie beschlossen. Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann hat die Änderung der Coronaschutzverordnung unterschrieben, die ab dem 20. April in Kraft tritt. &nbsp; Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet: „Bund und Länder haben sich am Mittwoch gemeinsam auf einen Weg in eine verantwortungsvolle Normalität geeinigt. Dass wir diese ersten Schritte jetzt gehen können, verdanken wir in erster Linie den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern: Jeder Einzelne hat durch sein persönliches Verhalten, durch das Einhalten von Regeln, durch den schmerzhaften Verzicht auf soziale Kontakte dazu beigetragen, dass die Ausbreitung des Coronavirus verlangsamt wurde. Dieser starke Zusammenhalt in unserer Gesellschaft beeindruckt mich und ich möchte mich dafür von Herzen bedanken. Jetzt gilt es, die erreichten Erfolge bei der Eindämmung der Pandemie beizubehalten und gleichzeitig verantwortungsvolle und konzentrierte Schritte zu gehen, um das öffentliche Leben langsam wieder entstehen zu lassen. Abstand und Schutz werden weiterhin Maßstab und Regel unseres Alltags bleiben.“ &nbsp; Mit der neuen Coronaschutzverordnung werden nun die Maßnahmen umgesetzt, die die Ministerpräsidentinnen und Ministerpräsidenten gemeinsam mit der Bundeskanzlerin am Mittwoch vereinbart haben. &nbsp; Insbesondere für den Handel ergeben sich Änderungen. So dürfen ab dem 20. April 2020 zusätzlich zu den bereits bekannten Handelseinrichtungen alle Buchhandlungen, Tierbedarfsmärkte, Bau- und Gartenbaumärkte einschließlich vergleichbaren Fachmärkten (z.B. Floristen, Sanitär-, Eisenwaren-, Malereibedarfs-, Bodenbelags- oder Baustoffgeschäfte) öffnen. Auch Einrichtungshäuser, Babyfachmärkte und Verkaufsstellen des Kraftfahrzeug- und des Fahrradhandels können wieder geöffnet werden. Außerdem dürfen grundsätzlich alle Handelseinrichtungen dann betrieben werden, wenn die reguläre Verkaufsfläche im Sinne des Einzelhandelserlasses NRW 800 Quadratmeter nicht übersteigt. Dabei sind alle Einrichtungen verpflichtet, Vorkehrungen zur Hygiene, zur Steuerung des Eintritts, zur Vermeidung von Warteschlangen und zur Gewährleistung eines Mindestabstands von 1,5 Metern zwischen Personen zu treffen. &nbsp; Auf Grundlage der Beschlüsse der Bundeskanzlerin mit den Ministerpräsidentinnen und Ministerpräsidenten plant das Ministerium für Schule und Bildung eine vorsichtige und gestufte Wiederaufnahme des Schulbetriebs. Am 20. April&nbsp;sollen in Nordrhein-Westfalen zunächst die&nbsp;weiterführenden Schulen wieder öffnen, vorerst jedoch nur, damit&nbsp;Lehrerinnen und Lehrer sowie die Schulträger die Wiederaufnahme des Schulbetriebs vorbereiten können. Ab Donnerstag, den 23. April 2020, können dann auf freiwilliger Basis die ersten&nbsp;Schülerinnen und Schüler, die in diesem Schuljahr Abschlussprüfungen ablegen zur&nbsp;Vorbereitung auf ihre Prüfungen wieder in die Schulen. Sollte die Entwicklung der Infektionsraten es zulassen, dann sollen die&nbsp;Schulen schrittweise ab dem 4. Mai 2020 geöffnet&nbsp;werden –&nbsp;zunächst für die Schülerinnen der Jahrgangsstufe 4 der Grundschulen, um diese Kinder so gut wie möglich auf den im Sommer bevorstehenden Wechsel auf die weiterführenden Schulen vorzubereiten. Diese erste Öffnung der Schulen ist nur unter Einhaltung strenger Vorgaben zum Hygiene- und Infektionsschutz möglich. Neben Vorgaben zu Hygieneplänen werden den Schulen in Kürze speziell entwickelte Handlungsempfehlungen zur schulischen Hygiene unter Pandemiebedingungen übermittelt. Die Gesundheit der Schülerinnen und Schüler sowie der Lehrkräfte und aller in Schule Beschäftigten hat für die Landesregierung oberste Priorität. &nbsp; Die geänderte Coronaschutzverordnung gilt für den Zeitraum vom 20. April bis zunächst zum 3. Mai 2020. Ende April werden die Ministerpräsidentinnen und Ministerpräsidenten und die Kanzlerin zu einem nächsten Gespräch zusammenkommen, um über weitere Schritte zu beraten.

Wir werden in Nordrhein-Westfalen die erwerbstätigen Alleinerziehenden, die in der aktuellen Situation besondere Herausforderungen zu meistern haben, unterstützen und entlasten.“ &nbsp; Darüber hinaus hat die Jugend- und Familienministerkonferenz beschlossen, unter Leitung von Nordrhein-Westfalen und Brandenburg ein Konzept zu erarbeiten, unter welchen Kriterien weitere Schritte der Öffnung der Kindertagesbetreuung möglich sind. Familienminister Stamp: „Mein Ministerium lädt dazu bereits heute ein, um gemeinsam mit Fachabteilungen aus Bund und Ländern unter wissenschaftlicher Begleitung durch Experten aus den Bereichen Kindheitspädagogik und Hygiene zu beraten.“ Entsprechende Empfehlungen sollen der Bundeskanzlerin und den Ministerpräsidenten rechtzeitig vor der nächsten gemeinsamen Beratung am 30.

Bei in Deutschland wohnhaften Personen soll nach der Einreise ein ausreichender Infektionsschutz gewährleistet werden. Alle Bundesländer – so auch Nordrhein-Westfalen – erlassen vor diesem Hintergrund Verordnungen zum Ein- und Rückreiseverkehr. &nbsp; Die Verordnung legt fest, dass Personen, die mehr als 72 Stunden im Ausland waren und dann nach Deutschland einreisen, sich auf direktem Weg in die eigene Häuslichkeit oder eine andere Unterkunft begeben müssen und diese 14 Tage nicht verlassen dürfen. Sie müssen sich beim Gesundheitsamt ihres Kreises bzw. ihrer kreisfreien Stadt melden. &nbsp; Abweichend davon sind Ausnahmen anerkannt, die das grenzüberschreitende Zusammenleben aufrechterhalten und die Funktionsfähigkeit des Gemeinwesens gewährleisten: Ausgenommen sind vor allem Grenzpendler – also Personen, die täglich oder für bis zu 5 Tage durch ihren Beruf oder ihre Ausbildung (Schule, Hochschule) veranlasst ein- und ausreisen. Ausgenommen sind Personen, die im grenzüberschreitenden Personen-, Waren- und Gütertransport tätig sind. Ausgenommen sind Personen, deren Tätigkeit notwendig ist zur Aufrechterhaltung des Gesundheitswesens und der Aufgaben des Staates. Ausgenommen sind schließlich Personen, die einen triftigen Reisegrund haben. Darunter fallen vor allem soziale Gründe wie ein geteiltes Sorgerecht, dringende medizinische Behandlungen, Betreuung von Kindern, Pflege von Angehörigen, Beerdigungen, Hochzeiten und Ähnliches. Diese Ausnahmen gelten, ohne dass es einer von einer Behörde erteilten Ausnahmegenehmigung bedarf. Weitere Ausnahmen und Befreiungen können im Einzelfall zugelassen werden. Zuständig dafür ist dann das Ordnungsamt der Stadt oder Gemeinde. Vor allem kann es Personen innerhalb der 14 Tage gestatten, ausnahmsweise ihren Aufenthaltsort zur Vornahme unaufschiebbarer Handlungen zu verlassen, die niemand anderes für sie erledigen kann. Außerdem kann es Personen, die nach ihrer Einreise negativ auf Corona getestet sind, von der Pflicht zum 14-tägigen Verbleib an ihrem Aufenthaltsort befreien. &nbsp; Diese vorgenannten Erläuterungen sind nicht der rechtsverbindliche Text.

Die vorsichtige und daher gestufte Wiederaufnahme des Schulbetriebs in Nordrhein-Westfalen erfolgt gleichsinnig wie in anderen Bundesländer. Sie ist behutsam darauf ausgelegt, die Schulen nicht zu überfordern. Und sie respektiert gleichzeitig die berechtigten Interessen der Schülerinnen und Schüler auf eine bestmögliche Prüfungsvorbereitung für den Abschluss ihrer jeweiligen Schullaufbahn“, so Schul- und Bildungsministerin Yvonne Gebauer. &nbsp; Am 20. April 2020 werden in Nordrhein-Westfalen zunächst die weiterführenden Schulen für Schulleitungen und Lehrkräfte wieder öffnen, um den Schulbetrieb vorzubereiten. Ab Donnerstag, den 23. April 2020, können ausschließlich die Schülerinnen und Schüler, die in diesem Schuljahr Abschlüsse anstreben, wieder in die Schulen. Ab dem 4. Mai sollen dann auch die Grundschulen ihren Schulbetrieb wiederaufnehmen, sollte die Entwicklung der Infektionsraten dies zulassen.

Mit der neuen Corona-Betreuungsverordnung sollen aber vor dem Hintergrund der behutsamen Lockerungen für weitere Wirtschaftsbereiche die Tätigkeitsbereiche der Eltern angepasst werden, die künftig die Notbetreuung in Anspruch nehmen können. Diese Anpassung orientiert sich ebenfalls an den Beschlüssen der Bundeskanzlerin mit den Ministerpräsidentinnen und Ministerpräsidenten aus dieser Woche. Ab 23.

Zugleich sollen Pflegebedürftige und Menschen mit Behinderungen auch weiterhin in den Einrichtungen aufgenommen werden können, die für ihre Bedürfnisse passend ausgestattet sind sowie über das qualifizierte Personal für die notwendige Pflege und Betreuung verfügen. Hierzu sind jedoch Maßnahmen erforderlich, die gewährleisten, dass die Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner der Einrichtungen und das Personal höchstmöglich vor Infektionen mit dem SARS-CoV-2 Virus geschützt werden. Die Rechtsverordnung sieht hier u. a. folgende Vorgaben vor: Krankenhäuser haben dafür Sorge zu tragen, dass diejenigen, die nach einer Krankenhausbehandlung in einer Pflegeeinrichtung oder Einrichtung der Eingliederungshilfe aufgenommen werden sollen, zum Zeitpunkt der Entlassung auf den SARS-CoV-2 Virus getestet werden. Über mögliche Erkrankungserscheinungen, z. B. Atemwegsinfekte, ist die aufnehmende Einrichtung schriftlich zu informieren. Bei Neuaufnahmen in die oben genannten Einrichtungen ist eine Testung auf eine Infektion mit dem SARS-CoV-2 Virus vorzunehmen bzw. zu veranlassen. In beiden Fällen ist durch eine entsprechende Kennzeichnung für eine prioritäre Analyse dieser Proben zu sorgen. &nbsp; Die Pflegeeinrichtungen und Einrichtungen der Eingliederungshilfe haben zudem unverzüglich Isolations- und Quarantänebereiche in einer für die Bewohnerzahl angemessenen Größe vorzubereiten. Vorgesehen ist eine getrennte Unterbringung von bereits infizierten Menschen einerseits und andererseits denjenigen, die keine Symptome einer Erkrankung an COVID-19 zeigen, aber bei denen noch kein negatives Testergebnis vorliegt. Grundsätzlich gilt dabei: Bei einer Neu- oder Wiederaufnahme ist der Bewohner für 14 Tage innerhalb des Quarantäne- bzw. Isolationsbereichs von allen anderen Bewohnern – auch innerhalb dieses Bereichs – getrennt unterzubringen, zu pflegen, zu betreuen und zu versorgen. Auch infizierte Bewohner müssen auf Anordnung der unteren Gesundheitsbehörde isoliert werden. &nbsp; Das Personal, das ausschließlich zur Versorgung in den Quarantäne- bzw. Isolationsbereichen eingesetzt wird, wird seitens des Betriebsarztes risikoabhängig auf eine Infektion getestet. Auch diese Proben sind prioritär zu analysieren. &nbsp; Die Rechtsverordnung ist heute (04.

Im Sinne eines gemeinsamen Vorgehens haben sich die Ministerpräsidentin von Rheinland-Pfalz sowie der Ministerpräsident von Nordrhein-Westfalen, Niedersachsen, sowie dem Saarland darauf verständigt, ab dem 27. April die bisherige dringende Empfehlung im ÖPNV und beim Einkaufen eine Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung bzw. eine sogenannte Alltagsmaske zu tragen, in eine Pflicht zu überführen. Bürgerinnen und Bürgern sowie Handelsunternehmen wird mit dem Inkrafttreten ab Montag die nötige Zeit gegeben, um sich auf die neuen Regelungen vorzubereiten. Bis dahin gilt weiter die dringende Bitte an die Bürgerinnen und Bürger im öffentlichen Personennahverkehr und beim Einkauf im Einzelhandel, Mund und Nase zu bedecken. &nbsp; Dazu erklärt Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet: „Nordrhein-Westfalen bleibt seiner Linie treu: Die Rückkehr in eine verantwortungsvolle Normalität bleibt eng verbunden mit einem konsequent verfolgten Schutz der Gesundheit. Wir brauchen möglichst ähnliche Regelungen in allen deutschen Ländern. Das Wichtigste bleibt: Abstand halten und die konsequente Einhaltung von Hygieneregeln. Nach Experten-Auffassung kann auch das Tragen von Alltagsmasken dazu beitragen, das Infektionsrisiko zu reduzieren. Wir müssen alles tun, was dabei hilft, umsichtig den Weg zurück zu einem Leben in Normalität zu finden. Die Maskenpflicht in einigen Bereichen des öffentlichen Lebens kann dabei sinnvoll unterstützen. Nordrhein-Westfalen wird seine Regelungen im Einzelhandel mit seinen Nachbarländern Niedersachsen, Hessen und Rheinland-Pfalz und der großen Mehrheit der anderen Länder dahingehend anpassen, dass es ab Montag auch möglich sein wird, unter Auflagen zur Hygiene, zur Steuerung des Zutritts und zur Vermeidung von Warteschlangen diejenigen Geschäfte öffnen zu können, die ihre Verkaufsfläche auf höchstens 800 Quadratmeter Verkaufsfläche reduzieren können.
