The ongoing pandemic is having a major impact on the Swedish economy. The focus of the crisis packages already presented has been to get measures in place quickly. Today sees the presentation of improvements to the system for short-term layoffs so that it will be even more impactful. It is proposed that the system of short-term layoffs be temporarily reinforced. The proposal means that employers will now be able to reduce their employees’ working hours by up to 80 per cent and that central government will cover a clear majority of the cost. This reinforcement of the system will apply for three months from 1 May 2020.The new system means that costs will be reduced even more for employers. The wage costs for an employee will be reduced by over 70 per cent while workers retain almost 90 per cent of their original wage. Combined with the reduced employers’ social security contributions, employers can be unburdened from up to 86 per cent of total wage costs during May and June.",https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/04/scaling-up-crisis-measures-for-jobs-and-businesses/

The decision was taken following a recommendation of the European Commission. The aim of the entry ban is, as previously, to mitigate the effects of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and reduce the outbreak of COVID-19. The temporary entry ban began to apply on 19 March and initially applied for 30 days. The entry ban has now been extended up to and including 15 May in accordance with the recommendation of the Commission (...) the entry ban essentially applies to all foreign citizens travelling to Sweden from all countries except EU Member States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.",https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/04/extension-of-temporary-entry-ban-to-the-eu-via-sweden-due-to-covid-19/

The measure involves reorientation support totalling SEK 39 billion. The aim of the support is to make it possible for businesses to weather the acute crisis while making it easier for them to reorient and adapt their activities. This could apply to restaurants that need to sell more food via takeaway orders or taxi companies that can start making deliveries. It could also involve major manufacturing companies that reorient their production to products such as health care materials. The size of the support will depend on how large a loss of turnover a business has had and may vary between 22.5 and 75 per cent of the business’s fixed costs excluding wage costs for March and April 2020. To be eligible for the support, the business must have had a turnover of at least SEK 250 000 during the past financial year and a loss of turnover of at least 30 per cent. The loss of turnover is calculated on the basis of March and April 2020 compared with the same months last year.",https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/04/businesses-to-receive-support-based-on-loss-of-turnover/

To date, however, start-ups have had little or even no access to the Confederation's existing emergency aid. Therefore, as a supplement to the federal COVID-19 credits and cantonal support measures, the Confederation is planning to use the system of guarantees to shield start-ups from coronavirus-related insolvency. Given the urgency, the Federal Council decided on 22 April 2020 to use the existing system of guarantees for SMEs to provide support for start-ups. This approach can be implemented without the need for a time-consuming legislative amendment. It is planned to create a new procedure for start-ups under the existing system of guarantees by 30 April 2020. The Confederation will guarantee 65% of a credit, and the cantons the remaining 35%. It is for individual cantons to decide whether they wish to offer this guarantee facility, originally intended for SMEs, to their start-ups.

The Governor unveiled $3.64 million in new funding to expand the state’s Farm to Family program, including $2.86 million from the USDA and $775,000 committed by philanthropy to jumpstart a $15 million campaign to further support the program through the end of the year. The Governor also highlighted critical expansions of CalFresh and EBT programs to combat food insecurity for low-income Californians, including a new Pandemic-EBT program for children who receive free or reduced lunch and EBT for online purchasing. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented level of demand at California food banks—seeing a year-over-year increase in demand of approximately 73 percent. The first three weeks of April, CalFresh saw a 140 percent increase in the number of applications over the same time last year and almost overnight, California farmers and ranchers simultaneously saw their market decrease by 50 percent. The fresh produce industry supply chain has been especially hard hit because of the perishability of the products that must be harvested, shipped and consumed in a short period of time. Nationally, the specialty crop producers estimate losses thus far at $5 billion in cancelled or reduced contracts. California accounts for at least one-half of that estimate. California’s Farm to Family program is a partnership between the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the California Association of Food Banks to facilitate food donations from farmers and ranchers by supporting food production, processing and distribution of the food supply chain. CDFA received approval from the USDA to redirect $2 million in unused Specialty Crop Block Grant funds to the California Association of Food Banks to offset the costs of picking, packing and transporting donated produce. An additional $861,854 from the USDA Farm to Food Bank program was awarded to the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to support the program. Farm to Family partners with 41 food banks serving all 58 counties, and handles the logistics of packaging the food and communicating with food banks.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/29/governor-newsom-announces-expansion-of-farm-to-family-program-and-new-initiatives-to-combat-food-insecurity/
