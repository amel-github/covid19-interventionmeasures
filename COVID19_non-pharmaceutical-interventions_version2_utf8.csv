However, contact tracing suggests that transmissions at common construction worksites may have contributed to the increase in numbers. Thus far, the cases detected among workers living outside the dormitories have been low. All those infected and their close contacts have been isolated. As a precautionary move, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will require all work permit holders and S Pass holders in the construction to be placed on mandatory stay-home notices (SHNs). This is to ensure that there is no further interactions between the workers and those outside their residential premises for two weeks. The SHN applies to all workers and their dependents in any place of accommodation, or any place which is converted into a place of accommodation on a temporary basis, or otherwise. It excludes those staying in any dormitory gazetted as an isolation area, or any foreign employee dormitory as defined in the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act 2015, as special arrangements have already been catered for them.

The ESG Loan Schemes comprise the Enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme - SME Working Capital Loan (EFS-WCL) and the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme (TBLP). The Facility will help financial institutions to make loans to SME borrowers more affordable.  In pricing SME loans, financial institutions typically take into account their cost of funds, their cost of underwriting, and a credit spread to reflect the risk profile of the borrower. By providing financial institutions funding at the low interest rate of 0.1% per annum, for a two-year tenor, the Facility reduces the financial institutions’ cost of funds for loans made under the ESG Loan Schemes.

Today sees the presentation of improvements to the system for short-term layoffs so that it will be even more impactful. It is proposed that the system of short-term layoffs be temporarily reinforced. The proposal means that employers will now be able to reduce their employees’ working hours by up to 80 per cent and that central government will cover a clear majority of the cost. This reinforcement of the system will apply for three months from 1 May 2020.The new system means that costs will be reduced even more for employers. The wage costs for an employee will be reduced by over 70 per cent while workers retain almost 90 per cent of their original wage. Combined with the reduced employers’ social security contributions, employers can be unburdened from up to 86 per cent of total wage costs during May and June.",https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/04/scaling-up-crisis-measures-for-jobs-and-businesses/

This could apply to restaurants that need to sell more food via takeaway orders or taxi companies that can start making deliveries. It could also involve major manufacturing companies that reorient their production to products such as health care materials. The size of the support will depend on how large a loss of turnover a business has had and may vary between 22.5 and 75 per cent of the business’s fixed costs excluding wage costs for March and April 2020. To be eligible for the support, the business must have had a turnover of at least SEK 250 000 during the past financial year and a loss of turnover of at least 30 per cent. The loss of turnover is calculated on the basis of March and April 2020 compared with the same months last year.",https://www.government.se/press-releases/2020/04/businesses-to-receive-support-based-on-loss-of-turnover/

The Governor also highlighted critical expansions of CalFresh and EBT programs to combat food insecurity for low-income Californians, including a new Pandemic-EBT program for children who receive free or reduced lunch and EBT for online purchasing. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented level of demand at California food banks—seeing a year-over-year increase in demand of approximately 73 percent. The first three weeks of April, CalFresh saw a 140 percent increase in the number of applications over the same time last year and almost overnight, California farmers and ranchers simultaneously saw their market decrease by 50 percent. The fresh produce industry supply chain has been especially hard hit because of the perishability of the products that must be harvested, shipped and consumed in a short period of time. Nationally, the specialty crop producers estimate losses thus far at $5 billion in cancelled or reduced contracts. California accounts for at least one-half of that estimate. California’s Farm to Family program is a partnership between the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the California Association of Food Banks to facilitate food donations from farmers and ranchers by supporting food production, processing and distribution of the food supply chain. CDFA received approval from the USDA to redirect $2 million in unused Specialty Crop Block Grant funds to the California Association of Food Banks to offset the costs of picking, packing and transporting donated produce. An additional $861,854 from the USDA Farm to Food Bank program was awarded to the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to support the program.
